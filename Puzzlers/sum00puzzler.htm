<P><B><I>The Liebig&#146;s Tube (170th Anniversary! in 2000) and the
A.C.S. Logo</I></B></P>

<P>The triangular, five&emdash;bulb tube that is surrounded by the
"ACS" in the A.C.S. logo is the <I>Liebig&#146;s Tube. </I>For years,
this then&emdash;ubiquitous tube was identified with chemistry as
well as was any other icon. (This identification no longer exists, as
evidenced by the very few responses I received.) What is the
Liebig&#146;s tube, and what was its purpose?</P>

<P>In the early part of the 19th century the determination of the
empirical formula of a pure compound, by combustion analysis, was a
literal hotbed of chemical inquiry. Among the contentious issues of
the time &endash; provoking sharp debate &endash; were such questions
as isomerism (can two different compounds possess the same empirical
formula?) and basicity (is there a direct correspondence between the
number of nitrogens in a molecule and the equivalents of acid
required for neutralization?). The answers to these questions
demanded, above all else, the mutual agreement of the empirical
formula. The laboratory that contributed decisively to this
conundrum, by the development of a reproducible (precise and
accurate) method of combustion analysis, was that of <B><I>Justus von
Liebig</I></B> (at the University of Giessen). The Liebig&#146;s
tube, filled with KOH, was used for the combustion analysis (<I>vide
infra: </I>presumably to trap CO<SUB>2</SUB>). Although first
described in 1830, it was notoriously difficult to make, and it was
some time thereafter before it became a common piece of laboratory
glassware. A practical method for its fabrication was devised by the
master glassblower at Giessen, <B><I>Carl Ettling</I></B>. Ettling
taught at least one other glassblower how to make the tube, after
which it became more available. With the advent of reliable empirical
formula data, the issue of isomerism was soon resolved (Liebig did
not directly contribute to this debate) as well as the relationship
of nitrogen quantity to basicity (Liebig originally believed this was
the case, but later corrected his conclusion). Liebig &endash; an
inorganic, organic, analytical and agricultural chemist &endash;
provides a most fitting image to our logo.</P>

<P>Liebig&#146;s role in the development of modern chemistry is
described succinctly by Brock, in a biographical essay (<I>Chem Rev.
</I><B>1996</B>, 383) and in Brock&#146;s fabulous short history of
chemistry ("The Norton History of Chemistry"). If you&#146;re a
chemist you should read this book! Regrettably, neither describes the
actual use of the tube (although see Brock&#146;s history p. 198 for
a fascinating description of the calculation of an empirical formula:
nothing like this today.) I presume that the answer might be found in
Brock&#146;s full biography of Liebig, that I do not have in my
library. If you do &endash; or know the answer &endash; please let me
know!</P>
