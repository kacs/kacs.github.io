         <P>  " 'Had silicon been a gas I would have been a major
         general' - James McNeill Whistler, from the vantage of
         celebrity on his departure from West Point in 1854, after
         flunking chemistry."     </P>
         
         <P>Cited in "Lab Notes: Experiments in Chemistry and Jazz"
         by Don Asher, Harper's Magazine, May 1999, p. 61 ff.</P>
         
         <P>This whimsical quote - it sounds like it belongs in a
         Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operetta - is found as the
         introductory comment to Don Asher's autobiographical
         reminiscence of his trials and tribulations in chemistry.
         Mr. Asher's real calling in life turned out to be as a jazz
         pianist, and his humorous essay makesit clear why. If anyone
         would like a photocopy of Asher's essay please contact me.
         (This was the first of two essays published last year on
         this topic. The second, a panegyric to chemistry by Oliver
         Sacks (very different than Asher's essay) appeared late last
         year in The New Yorker. An expanded version will be
         published shortly in book form.)</P>
         
         <P>James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) was born in
         Massachusetts but spent much of his early youth in Russia
         where his father, a career military officer, was assigned.
         Following his father's death in 1849, he returned to the
         United States to enroll in the West Point Military Academy
         in 1851. Within three years, however, an unfortunate
         experience with chemistry led to his dismissal from the
         Academy. After brief employment with the Coast &amp;
         Geodesic Service (where he assisted in mapmaking, and
         received useful training in etching) he left the United
         States in 1855, never to return. The rest is art
         history.</P>
         
         <P>Our Winner: </P>
         
         <P>Our winner is Richard Meury, of the Pharmacia
         Corporation, who combined my disparate clues with (what I
         must presume to be a wonderful sense of) art history into a
         dead-on answer. My congratulations!</P>
