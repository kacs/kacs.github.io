         <P><I>Linus Pauling (From an address given at Yale
         University, October 1947):</I></P>
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>"When it has become possible to
               determine in detail the molecular structure of the
               vectors of disease and of the constituents of the
               cells of the human body, it will be possible to draw
               up the specifications of a specific chemotherapeutic
               agent to protect the body against a specific danger,
               and then to proceed to synthesize the agent according
               to the specifications."</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
         
         <P>Our clairvoyant is the inimitable Linus Pauling. There
         are two perspectives to interpret his statement. The first
         is that he was reflecting backward, with this quote merely
         an elegant restatement of Emil Fischer's "lock and key"
         hypothesis. If one knows the design of the tumblers of the
         lock, surely one can then intuit the geometry of the key?
         The second is that he was visionary, with this quote
         reflecting a forceful statement of his emerging
         understanding of the chemical basis for biochemical
         structure, catalysis, and information encoding. Pauling was,
         I believe, doing both. But the clarity of his vision, in
         contrast to the muddled thought that still gripped
         mechanistic and structural biological chemistry, is
         remarkable. The concept of vitalism as an impenetrable,
         mystical component of biological phenomena had only recently
         succumbed to the heroic experimental efforts of Sumner,
         Northrup and Kunitz. In 1947 the structural aspects of
         proteins were speculative debate, and the structural basis
         of genetics a brash new frontier. Yet Pauling knew that it
         was <I>all</I> chemistry!<I> </I>At the most fundamental
         level organic, inorganic and biological chemistry were
         identical: <I>these are disciplines of atoms, in beautiful
         arrays of molecules. </I>Pauling resonated with absolute
         certitude that the entirety of the tangible &endash; whether
         by touch or by experiment &endash; biochemical universe was
         molecular. And the molecular machines that controlled
         biological phenomena (whatever their structure) could be
         deceived by mimicry of the very molecules they manipulated,
         and that this was indeed the past, and the future, of
         chemotherapeutic design.</P>

         <P><I>Our Responders: </I>Responses were received from Dave
         Anderson, Mike Kiella and John Stodola. <I>Our Winner:
         </I>John Stodola, with "Linus Pauling in the 1940's" as
         close a guess as I ever could have expected.</P>
         
         <P><I>The January 2000 Puzzler: </I>I've received two
         guesses thus far but neither is correct. This shouldn't be
         all that difficult: A clue is found in what you've just
         read!</P>
