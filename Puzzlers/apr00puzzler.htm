         <P>This was a tough one! |While I didn't receive a correct
         answer, but I do extend my thanks to Dave Anderson and Paul
         Aristoff for their educated guesses. While the name
         reflexively associated with the rotary evaporator is that of
         its Swiss manufacturer, it is indeed an American invention
         made by a true chemical inventor, Lyman Craig, in the early
         1940's while at the Rockefeller University. Craig's awards
         in chemistry included the Lasker Award, the Kolthoff medal,
         and membership in the National Academy. The all-too-brief
         obituary published by C&amp;E News (22 Jul 1974)
         acknowledges Craig for his invention of the glass
         countercurrent distribution apparatus (an invention now
         firmly supplanted by technology) without mention of his one
         simple yet outstanding invention that still spins, even
         today, in thousands of laboratories around the world. Thanks
         once again, Lyman. </P>
