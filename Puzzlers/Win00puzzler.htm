         <P>"In its early youth, organic chemistry was so closely
         connected to biology. I do consider it not only possible,
         but desirable, that the close connection of chemistry and
         biology .... should be reestablished, as the great chemical
         secrets of life are only to be unveiled by cooperative
         work."</P>
         
         <P><I>-Emil Fischer (taken from the Faraday Lecture,
         published J. Chem. Soc. 1907, 1749.<BR>
         (Quoted by Waldmann et al. ChemBiochem 2000, 1, 144)</I></P>
         
         <P>"It is the discipline of science that enables all of us
         ordinary people, whether we be chemists or biologists, to go
         about doing the ordinary things, which when assembled,
         reveal the extraordinary intricacies and awesome beauties of
         nature"</P>
         
         <P><I>-Arthur Kornberg, taken from his essay "Centenary of
         the Birth of Modern Biochemistry"<BR>
         FASEB J. 1997, 11, 1209 </I></P>
         
         <P>Kornberg is my selection as the scientist to succeed
         Fischer as the bio-chemical visionary for the start of this
         new century. Kornberg is among the biochemical greats of the
         twentieth century, whose intolerance for experiments with
         "dirty" reagents is justifiably famous. He has written
         several essays on the topic of
         chemistry&endash;biochemistry&endash;biology synergism over
         the past dozen years (the citation above is the most
         recent). While his understanding of modern organic chemistry
         is simplistic (as will be evident immediately to the
         bio-organic or medicinal chemist who ventures into his
         writings), the certitude of his conviction that
         genomics/proteomics are self-limiting with respect to the
         extraordinary intricacies, emerges unchallenged. The
         profound revelations of Nature for the future will be made
         by extraordinary teams of ordinary chemists, biologists,
         engineers, physicists ...... all working together, as an
         integrated ensemble of discoverers.</P>
