         <P>The scientific transformation of the past century is
         breathtaking. At the start of the twentieth century only
         rudimentary biochemical details were known, and the entirety
         of biological chemistry was gripped with the conviction that
         an extraordinary difference separated the hot cauldrons of
         laboratory organic and inorganic chemistry, and the
         effortless elegance of the chemistry of life. Yet by the
         middle of the century Linus Pauling <I>knew </I>that
         everything was molecular, and that chemistry encompassed -
         in totality and without exception - biochemistry (see the
         answer to December's puzzler). It may be surmised correctly
         that Pauling's understanding was built upon irrefutable
         scientific observation. But whose accomplishment was
         this?</P>
         
         <P>James Batcheller Sumner (1887-1955), born left-handed,
         lost his left arm following a childhood accident. He
         enrolled at Harvard with the intention to major in
         engineering, but found himself drawn to chemistry. Lacking
         an acceptance to graduate school following his graduation,
         he worked briefly at the family factory before accepting a
         teaching position in chemistry. Although Sumner was able to
         return to Harvard shortly thereafter as a graduate student
         in biochemistry, he was actively discouraged from pursuing a
         career in chemistry by his research advisor, who told him
         candidly that there would be no opportunity in science for
         someone with his physical limitation. But Sumner's
         enthusiasm and skill prevailed, and he secured his doctorate
         with Otto Folin in 1914. After his graduation Sumner
         accepted what was primarily a teaching position at the
         Cornell Medical School. As both the resources and time
         available to him for research were limited, he decided to
         focus on a single but significant problem: were the
         catalysts of biochemical transformation - enzymes - discrete
         molecular entities? Sumner chose the hydrolysis of urea (to
         ammonia and carbon dioxide) as the chemical reaction to
         study for two reasons. The background velocity of the
         reaction was zero, and a catalytic entity for this reaction
         was known to be found in abundance in a particular bean
         (jack bean). Over a period of a dozen years Sumner perfected
         a method for the purification and crystallization of jack
         bean urease, and reported in 1926 that jack bean urease was
         a crystalline compound composed only of amino acids. At
         first he was ignored - the prevailing theory was that
         proteins were structural, and not catalytic entities - but
         as he held steadfast to his conclusions he was greeted with
         skepticism and ridicule. But he was right. During the
         1930's, as the methods for establishing protein purity
         improved dramatically, Sumner's conclusions prevailed. He
         was a co-winner of the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</P>
         
         <P>Well, he was nearly right. A rigorous re-examination of
         carefully purified jack bean urease in 1975 (Zerner <I>et
         al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. </I><B>1977</B>, <I>97</I>, 4131-4132)
         revealed that this protein is composed not <I>just </I>of
         amino acids but possesses also a catalytically active
         nickel. As befits the extraordinary activation energy for
         urea hydrolysis, Nature had recruited a Lewis acid to
         facilitate this reaction.</P>
         
         <P>On several levels Sumner is a chemist worth remembering.
         He focussed on the tough problem. He persevered despite
         physical adversity, and despite the open skepticism of his
         colleagues, by a focus on uncompromising experimental
         rigor.</P>
         
         <P>Two excellent guesses - from Paul Aristoff and Paul
         Dobrowolski - were received to my puzzler (neither correct,
         however). And much to my dismay my February puzzler hasn't
         received as yet a single guess! Perhaps I should have stayed
         with famous chemists, rather than a famous
         mid-19<SUP>th</SUP> century American artist tossed out of
         West Point because he couldn't pass chemistry?</P>
