      Project SEED provides <strong>summer research experiences</strong> in chemistry for
      <strong>high school students from low income
	households</strong>. This has been a powerful
	program. <strong>Over 11,000 students have
	participated</strong> in the last 50+ years
	and <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i11/Celebrating-Project-SEEDs-impact.html">ACS
	Assessments</a> show that it has had a strong impact on the
	academic and career pathways of those students. The
      <strong>Kalamazoo local section has sponsored 75 student
	projects</strong> in the last 25
	years. The <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/donate/project-seed-inspiration-lab/who-seed-inspires.html">ACS
	Project SEED website</a> shows some short, inspiring videos
	that explain how the program has changed student lives.

  Each Project SEED fellowship <strong>costs our local section between
    $1250 &ndash; $1500</strong> in addition to matching funds from
    ACS. Our goal is to raise enough funds each year to
    fund <strong>at least two projects per summer</strong>. 100% of
    donated funds go directly toward student research
    stipends. Project mentors and their institutions receive no
    payment for their participation in Project SEED.
