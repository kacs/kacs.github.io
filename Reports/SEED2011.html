					<p><b>Project SEED 2011 Reception</b></p>
		        <p>SEED is an acronym for Science Experience for the Economically Disadvantaged; Project SEED is a program established with funds from Alfred Bader, founder of Aldrich Pharmaceuticals, and administered by ACS through Local Sections.  Students are solicited from Local Section High school teachers and go through an application process; the coordinator tries to get commitments from local industry and/or academe for these students to spend 8 weeks during the summer months in a &quot;research environment&quot; with the ultimate intent that they can see what chemical research is like and decide to continue in their study of chemistry.    In more recent years industrial mentors have been hard to find so students have spent their 8 weeks at WMU.  This year our only participant was Amarachi Ndebedum, who graduated from Kalamazoo Central HS in 2011 and is on her way to Grand Valley State University; her mentor was Sherine Obare.</p>
