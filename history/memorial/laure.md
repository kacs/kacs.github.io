LAURE, George R.
===

Age 99

Of Portage

Mr. Laure passed away early Friday morning, September 30, 2011 at
Fountain View Assisted Living. He was born April 20, 1912 in Chicago,
IL, the son of Andrew and Rosa (Rath) Laure and grew up in South Bend,
IN. On June 10, 1934, George was united in marriage to the former
Esther L. Wells. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in
1938 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. It was at the University
of Notre Dame where he developed an early interest in the emerging
field of plastics. After graduation, George was employed at Seagram's
Distilleries in Lawrenceburg, Indiana and Louisville, Kentucky as a
plant chemical engineer for one and one half years. He then was
employed by The Upjohn Company in Kalamazoo for nine years. He was in
charge of Packaging Development. While there, he was instrumental in
developing a wound package for soldiers. George also was involved in
research and development for all packaging projects to test chemical
and mechanical stability. While at Upjohn, he investigated the
possibility of incorporating plastics molding at The Upjohn
Company. When this did not materialize, he began his experimentation
in the basement of his home. For one year, he spent eight hours each
day at Upjohn and eight hours in the basement of his home
experimenting with plastics. Then, he made the decision to leave
Upjohn to pursue the development of a plastics molding company. In
1945, The W-L Molding Company was formed. For 66 years, this company
has provided numerous jobs for the Portage community. All of this was
possible because of George Laure's outstanding leadership and his vast
array of talents and abilities. Kalamazoo County is a stronghold for
the plastics industry. This is due in large part to the capabilities
and successes of Mr. Laure. After learning the trade, many former
employees have gone on to form their own plastics companies in the
community. He also founded Portage's LaRos Equipment Company,
Inc. This company produces product-handling equipment, conveyors, and
labor-saving devices for the plastics industry. He was a pioneer in
the design and manufacture of custom plastics products for primarily
industrial clients. He also had an interest in orthopedic
implants. George collaborated with a Cleveland surgeon to manufacture
artificial joints for the wrist, hand, and toe. He also worked on the
design and manufacture of a plastic bowling pin. George was a
long-time aviation enthusiast. He held a commercial pilot's license,
airplane single and multi-engine (land) and instrument ratings. He
owned many different types of aircraft in his active flying years. He
was instrumental in the founding of the Portage Rotary Club and served
as its first President. George recently achieved 50 years of perfect
attendance. Rotary was a vital part of his life and he loved his
fellow Rotarians. George was a charter member of the Notre Dame Club
of Kalamazoo. In 2008, he received its coveted Award of the
Year. Mr. Laure provided an example of dedication to the spirit of
entrepreneurship for others to emulate. What he has brought to bear on
behalf of the community merits nothing less than unqualified
praise. Surviving are his three children, Shirley Rossio of Wayland,
MI, Barbara Mellinger of Costa Mesa, CA and James (Debbie) Laure of
Vicksburg. Also surviving are eight grandchildren, Kim (Keith)
Anderson of Wayland, Lisa (Bob) Holz of Lebanon, OH, Debbie (Ken)
Magee of Belgrade, MT, Judy (Mark) Alexander of Huntington Beach, CA,
Steve (Mandy) Mellinger III of New Carlisle, IN, Brandon, Shaylin and
Mariah Laure of Vicksburg; 16 great-grandchildren; many nieces,
nephews, and friends. Preceding him in death were his wife of 66
years, Esther Laure, on April 3, 2001; his parents, Andrew and Rosa
Laure; one brother, three sisters, and grandson, Christopher
Rossio. Honoring Mr. Laure's wishes, cremation has taken place with a

Park. Friends may visit with the family from 10 AM to 1 PM and 3 PM to
