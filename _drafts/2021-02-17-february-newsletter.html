<h1 id="">National ACS President to Address KACS</h1>

<p>
  We will have a very special guest for our
  February 22 meeting, starting at 6:30 p.m.:
</p>

<h2>H.N. Cheng, Ph.D.</h2>
<p>2021 President,<br /> American Chemical Society</p>

  <h2>Sustainability and Green Chemistry</h2>
<p>
  With increasing public awareness of climate change, environmental
  pollution, and earth’s declining resources, sustainability and green
  chemistry have become hot topics these days. In 2015, the United
  Nations adopted 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to be
  achieved in 2030. As polymers are being used all around us, they play
  a major role in the achievement of these goals. In this talk, the
  speaker will provide an overview of the sustainability initiatives at
  American Chemical Society (ACS) and his platform as ACS President
  in 2021. He will also cover selected polymer research and
  development (R&amp;D) areas that are related to sustainability and green
  polymer chemistry. The following examples will be shown: 1) to use
  natural renewable raw materials (e.g., polysaccharides, proteins, and
  triglycerides) as source materials for new chemistry and products; 2)
  to exploit biocatalysts (e.g., enzymes and micro-organisms) for
  chemical and polymer conversions; 3) to apply green chemistry
  concepts to conversion and processing; and 4) to develop green
  methodologies to promote the development of green products. In
  view of the relevance of sustainability and green polymer chemistry
  to our society, we can expect to see continued R&amp;D and commercial
  activities relating to this field in the future.

<h1 id="">KACS Holds Virtual Speed-Networking Event on January 26</h1>
<p class="author">By Lucas Chadwick and Blakely Tresca</p>

<img src="" alt="Networking stock art" />

<p>
  Kalamazoo College and the Kalamazoo ACS hosted the 4th annual Speed
  Networking Night over Zoom this year. After Dr. Blakely Tresca
  welcomed everyone, Dr. Jeff Bartz gave a brief history of the
  award-winning speed-networking event. For the virtual event, mentors
  and students were paired up in breakout rooms for 10-minute
  discussions. After the first breakout session, Dr. Ed Thomas
  presented the many benefits of ACS membership for students, the need
  to revitalize the Education Committee, and welcomed all to
  participate in the KACS local section. The night continued with five
  alternating networking breakouts and presentations by invited
  speakers. Other presentations included an overview of
  career-building resources by Dr. Tricia Zelaya- Leon from the
  K-college Career Development Center, an impassioned plea from Dr. Ed
  Thomas for personnel in academia to get more involved in the KACS
  Education Committee. The highlight of the night was Mr.  Benjamin
  Maxey’s presentation on the story of Covid-19 vaccine production at
  Pfizer here in Kalamazoo. The night concluded with one last breakout
  session. After the event, a list of contacts was circulated for
  mentors and students to continue their conversations. We are hopeful
  the connections that were made will benefit students and mentors
  alike for many years to come. Overall, our first-ever virtual
  chemistry speed- networking event was a resounding success, and we
  look forward to working with this format more in the future.

  As a Section we extend our appreciation those who contributed time
  and expertise for our Virtual Speed- Networking Event:

      After careful review, ACS has decided to cancel in-person
      Project SEED research programs again this summer. With this
      decision, ACS will focus on staffing and running an expanded
      Project SEED Virtual Summer Camp from June 21 – July 30 (6
      weeks) for 450-470 high school students from disadvantaged
      situations. Please see and share this

	 title="Project SEED 2021 brochure">brochure</a> for more
      details. The student application portal is expected to open by
      April. A student information session was given online February
      9, which was recorded and can be viewed by
      <a href="https://american-chemical-society.zoom.us/rec/share/Yno8KAIQNEvELhPeq1yVrCP08fJXJvkq4Zq-mvG24QRf3LV0Nc-7B1Fx7iUg0q8.kF5077D2oCJfLZrJ?startTime=1612911581000"

<p>
  ACS is seeking chemists and other specialists to volunteer to support the Summer Camp program:
  <ul>
    <li>Camp Managers will oversee a group of 10-30 students and 2-6
      Cabin Leaders (see below) and host weekly meetings.</li>
    <li>Mentors will share their work with a "cabin" (8-10 students)
      by introducing the students to their science and developing
      projects or activities for the students to work on over the
      course of six weeks.</li>
    <li>Webinar facilitators will give presentations relevant to high
      school student development in pursuing STEM
      education. Presentations with high-engagement approaches are
      desirable.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  ACS plans to hire even more Cabin Leaders this year. These are
  typically graduate students or undergraduate students in chemistry
  who will be online with their cabin each day to facilitate
  participation and serve as go-to leaders and role models for the
  participants. Flyers for Cabin Leaders will be available by early
  March and the applications will open soon after.
