Please consider giving of your time and talent for our local section. Feel free to contact any of the current officers to indicate your interest. (Click the Officers link in the menu for contact information.)

Some specific volunteer needs are listed below.

**Chair-elect (2014):** This is a leadership position that includes some
expense-paid leadership training (and ACS indoctrination). The
chair-elect becomes section chair in the second year of service. It
helps to have some experience with local section programming and a
positive impression of the ACS mission. If chemistry has been good to
you, this is an excellent way to share your enthusiasm for our
discipline.

**National Chemistry Week (NCW) Committee:** This team coordinates our
public outreach programs in celebration of National Chemistry Week
(October of each year). We usually support a community access TV
interview and cosponsor a hands-on Chemistry Day program for youth and
their families at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum (KVM). The Chemistry Day
event depends upon excellent help from the KVM staff and dozens of our
dedicated ACS members, local teachers and students, who teach and
guide participants through the activities on Chemistry Day. The NCW
committee gets things started each year and keeps it
organized. Contact [Lydia Hines](mailto:lemhwgh@gmail.com "Email Lydia")
for a more detailed list of duties.

**Section Archivist:** If you are interested in history and like to
organize and write, we would love to talk to you about updating our
Local Section History (which now goes only through 1981). Contact
[Lydia Hines](mailto:lemhwgh@gmail.com "Email Lydia") to discuss.
