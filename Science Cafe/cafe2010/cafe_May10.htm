					<h3 align="center"><font size="-1">The Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical Society held a Science Caf&eacute; event on 18 May 2010. &nbsp;It featured Dr. Todd Barkman, a biologist at Western Michigan University, who led a discussion of &ldquo;Biochemical Diversity: From odorants to stimulants.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Barkman&rsquo;s cross-disciplinary expertise was evident as he clearly and humorously described the chemistry and the biology associated with biosynthesis of methylsalicylate (&ldquo;Oil of Wintergreen&rdquo;) and caffeine.&nbsp; About 30 people participated in the presentation and discussion. &nbsp;Science Caf&eacute; was held upstairs at Martini's Pizza in Kalamazoo.<br>

							The next Science Caf&eacute;&nbsp;is planned for September.</font></h3>
