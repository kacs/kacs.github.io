      <p><br>
        Irving O&#146;Leary, age 50, died Tuesday, March 12, 2002, after a courageous 
        battle against brain cancer. Irving was a long time employee of Pharmacia

        Society. Irving was active in public outreach for the Kalamazoo Section. 
        In particular, he loved doing Chemistry for students in the Mattawan school 
        district.<br>
        <br>
        Born April 19, 1951, in Benton Harbor, Irving grew up on a family centennial 
        fruit farm in Coloma. He went on to distinguish himself at Coloma High

        made his final career move to Upjohn (now Pharmacia) in Kalamazoo in 1982.<br>
        <br>
        He worked at Pharmacia even after his cancer was diagnosed and up until 
        seven months before his death. Throughout his illness, he contributed
