      An <strong>early announcement</strong> about our section's
      participation in <em>Chemists Celebrate Earth Day</em>; we once
      again hope to have outreach events at the Celery Flats in Portage
      and at the Kalamazoo Nature Center, and at any other venues where we
      can have interested volunteers. Note that this outreach event is in
      its <strong>15th year</strong> and has been re-labeled <em>Chemists
	Celebrate Earth Week</em> (CCEW); it will be
      celebrated <strong>April 22-28, 2018</strong>, the topic
      is <em>Oceans</em> and the theme of the publication from the ACS
      Outreach office will be <em>Dive into Marine Chemistry</em>, which
      will discuss the chemistry of water from the ocean. The common goal
      for CCEW, as well as any other activity of our ACS, is to
      communicate the positive role that chemistry plays in the world.

	<h3>The Real Crisis with Flint's Water: It Was Preventable and Can Happen to You!</h3>
	<p class="author">
	  By Monique Wilhelm, University of Michigan-Flint Laboratory Manager
	  and Chemical Hygiene Officer
	</p>
	<p>
	  Everyone has heard about the health effects that resulted from the
	  change of the source of water for the city of Flint. The national
	  media has chosen to focus on the health issues and on whom to
	  blame. But do you really know what made Flint's water unsafe?
	  Without going into the politics of the decision or trying to
	  identify blame, the audience will participate in a hands on activity
	  to learn more about what happened with the water from an elementary
	  chemistry viewpoint. The presenter will also discuss some of the
	  side effects this community is experiencing that aren't being
	  addressed in the media from the viewpoint of someone living through
	  this crisis.

	<p>
	  Bill Schinzer will be taking over the KACS Treasurer duties as
	  Andre Venter begins his sabbatical in Paris this month. Bill earned
	  his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Indiana University and worked
	  for the Upjohn Company and its successor companies of years past.
	  He worked with analytical R&amp;D groups, developing methods and
	  solving interesting problems for both drug product and drug
	  substance support. Bill is a veteran of several Boy Scout Chemistry
	  Merit Badge days. In 2006 he started work for Eurofins, a small
	  contract research organization in Portage, serving as their Director
	  of Method Development. In late 2010 he started his own firm, Arrow
	  Pharma Services LLC. He currently works with large pharmaceutical
	  firms as well as startups developing new drugs, generally helping
	  them solve chemistry and pharmaceutics problems. Bill and his wife,
	  Martie, live in Portage and enjoy driving along in their 1974 VW
	  Bus. Their children, Eric and Chris, are not as fond of the bus,
	  perhaps because it used to honk its own horn occasionally.
