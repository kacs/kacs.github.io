I want to introduce our new Education Committee Chair, <strong>Mike
Walsh</strong>. Mike has a varied and interesting background, earning
his BS in Chemistry at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. After a
stint as an Army Medical Officer, Mike earned his Masters Degree from
Mississippi State in 1992. Since then, Mike has served as a substitute
teacher and tutor in Saginaw County, and as a Wastewater Analyst and
Analytical Chemist in a number of places across the state. Mike landed
in Kalamazoo in 2000 with KAR Labs, and has been the <strong>Director
of Chemical Laboratories at K College</strong> since 2010. We are
excited to have Mike on board, and you can read his report of our
annual Awards Gathering below. Education in all forms is a pillar of
our Section. Welcome, Mike!
