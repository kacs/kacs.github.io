<!-- Insert bio here -->

I am grateful for the opportunity to chair our local section.  The ACS
played a key role in the start of my 32 year career as a
pharmaceutical scientist. In 1984 as a graduating student member, I
attended the ACS national meeting in St. Louis, and via the Employment
Clearing House landed a position in Monsanto's new Bioprocess
Development Group. Kalamazoo has also played a key role in my
career. Since going to work for Upjohn here in 1988, and working
through the Pharmacia - Pfizer - Zoetis changes, I've come to know
Kalamazoo as an excellent community in which to live. Chairing our
local section brings together an opportunity to connect and contribute
to these two important pieces for me, Kalamazoo and the ACS, so thanks
for that.
