  Hello, Kalamazoo-area chemists! I am excited to be the next local
  section Communications Chair.  While I know it will be nearly
  impossible to fill David Bolliet's empty seat, I will do my best to
  keep you informed about community events and news.  However, before
  I get to work, I thought you might like to know a little about
  me. While I was born and raised right here in Kalamazoo, it was only
  recently that I was again able to call this place home after nearly
  twenty years away. So, here is my story&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  I attended Valparaiso University where I graduated in 1999 with
  honors in Chemistry. During two of my undergrad summer vacations I
  completed internships right here in Kalamazoo at Pharmacia &amp;
  Upjohn (1998) and Pharmacia (1999) before heading off to graduate
  school. I completed my doctoral work in Richard Silverman's lab at
  Northwestern University were I studied MOA-B inactivators (2004). At
  this point I left the shores of Lake Michigan to live in the desert
  of Arizona. For ten years I was a full-time teaching faculty at
  Arizona State University where I oversaw the undergraduate organic
  chemistry teaching labs (~1200 students) and taught ground and
  online organic chemistry lectures (~400 students). While at ASU my
  scholarly interests focused on the use of media in chemical
  education and on improving ways to mentor developing chemistry
  educators. In the spring of 2011 I was awarded the College of
  Liberal Arts and Science's Outstanding Lecturer Award. My
  involvement with ACS local sections began in Arizona, and for two
  years (2006 &amp; 2007) I was the Central Arizona local section
  chair.

  Despite my positive experiences in Arizona, in the spring of 2014 I
  left my Senior Lecturer position at ASU to pursue a new challenge as
  the Chemistry Subject Matter Expert at W. W. Norton and Co, an
  employee-owned publishing company based out of Manhattan. I work out
  of my home assisting our online homework faculty users with their
  courses and developing new chemistry multi-media learning tools with
  the Norton product team and editorial staff. This new position gave
  our family the freedom to move back to this much colder climate. (I
  personally did not like the 120 degree summers!) When not working, I
  enjoy spending time with my husband Tim, my two children (8 and 6
  years old), and my two dogs. Some of my hobbies include reading, rug
  weaving, home re-modeling (Tim and I flipped three homes in AZ),
  hiking, bargain-shopping, and meeting new people!
</p>
<p>
  That being said&hellip;I look forward to meeting you at an upcoming
  local section event!
