  I am pleased to serve as the 2020 Chair Elect and 2021 Chair of
  the Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical Society. I have
  over 35 years of pharmaceutical research and development
  experience and am a member of ACS for 47 years.
</p>
<p>
  With all the benefits I have received from the ACS, I decided it
  was time to give back. In the past I given demonstrations at
  Chemistry Day and visited local elementary schools to share with
  them the excitement of science and chemistry. Last year I was
  super charged by our local section receiving the prestigious ACS
  National Historic Chemistry Landmark Award. I especially enjoyed
  the chemistry symposium on the day of the award, May 17, 2019,
  and the social event and dinner the previous evening. I wish to
  continue on the local committee to implement interesting
  scientific member meetings.
</p>
<p>
  Membership enjoyment and participation, scientific meetings and
  education are my focus for this year. I hope you share with me or
  other executive members your interests and needs. Please feel free
  to contact me.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to helping the Kalamazoo ACS section achieve
  Hershel Jude's and our local section's goals through successful
  activities and increased membership participation.
</p>
<p>
  Edward W. Thomas<br />
  KACS Chair-Elect
