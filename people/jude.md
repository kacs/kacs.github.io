I grew up in Eastern Kentucky and received a B.A. in chemistry from
Berea College in Berea, Kentucky where I served as president of the
Berea College Student ACS chapter. I earned a M.S. and Ph.D. in
Chemistry from the University of Cincinnati with Professor William
B. Connick, where my research focused on the synthesis and
characterization of two-electron platinum reagents. After graduate
school, I spent two years as a post-doctoral associate at the
University of Utah with Professor Peter J. Stang and three years as a
Post-Doctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Lab with Dr. Reginaldo
Rocha. While in Professor Stang's group, my research focused on the
development and characterization of two- and three-dimensional
supramolecular assemblies and while working with Dr. Rocha I developed
ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts for the oxidation of water. In 2008, I
moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan and joined Kalsec as a lead scientist
where I currently focus on developing new hop products and processes
for the brewing industry.


I live in Kalamazoo township with my wife and two children (10 and
7). In my free time, I enjoy bowling, camping, biking and reading. I
am very passionate about the ACS and what it offers it members,
particularly the education and career components. My adventures with
the ACS started with my first oral presentation late on Thursday
afternoon at a national meeting in Washington, D.C. That 20-minute
talk, which lasted 10 minutes due to being nervous and speaking so
fast, was a great learning experience. An interview at the 2008
National Meeting in New Orleans led to me relocating to Kalamazoo. My
first experience with an ACS local section was the KACS [Sustainable
Science - Recycle a Poster](/event/2018/11/13/sutainable-science.html)
event at Bell's Eccentric Caf√© and I have since volunteered several
times at the Chemistry Day at the Museum event and participated in
many other KACS events. I would love to hear from KACS members about
their experiences with KACS and the types of events and activities
they would enjoy attending.
