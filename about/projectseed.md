# Project SEED

Project SEED provides **summer research experiences** in chemistry for
**high school students from low income households**. This has been a
powerful program. **Over 11,000 students have participated** in the
last 50+ years and [ACS
Assessments](https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i11/Celebrating-Project-SEEDs-impact.html)
show that it has had a strong impact on the academic and career
pathways of those students. The **Kalamazoo local section has
sponsored 75 student projects** in the last 25 years. The [ACS Project
SEED
website](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/donate/project-seed-inspiration-lab/who-seed-inspires.html)
shows some short, inspiring videos that explain how the program has
changed student lives.

Each Project SEED fellowship **costs our local section about $2000**
in addition to matching funds from ACS. Our goal is to raise enough
funds each year to fund **at least two projects per summer**. 100% of
donated funds go directly toward student research stipends. Project
mentors and their institutions receive no payment for their
participation in Project SEED.

You may **donate** directly to our KACS Project SEED fund on
PayPal. Kalamazoo ACS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
