      Project SEED provides <strong>summer research experiences</strong> in chemistry for
      <strong>high school students from low income
	households</strong>. This has been a powerful
	program. <strong>Over 11,000 students have
	participated</strong> in the last 50+ years
	and <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i11/Celebrating-Project-SEEDs-impact.html">ACS
	Assessments</a> show that it has had a strong impact on the
	academic and career pathways of those students. The
      <strong>Kalamazoo local section has sponsored 75 student
	projects</strong> in the last 25
	years. The <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/donate/project-seed-inspiration-lab/who-seed-inspires.html">ACS
	Project SEED website</a> shows some short, inspiring videos
	that explain how the program has changed student lives.

Each Project SEED fellowship **costs our local section about $2000**
in addition to matching funds from ACS. Our goal is to raise enough
funds each year to fund **at least two projects per summer**. 100% of
donated funds go directly toward student research stipends. Project
mentors and their institutions receive no payment for their
participation in Project SEED.

You may **donate** directly to our KACS Project SEED fund on
PayPal. Kalamazoo ACS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
