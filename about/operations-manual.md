Project SEED is part of the American Chemical Society's (ACS) commitment to the development of a scientific work force that is more broadly representative of the American population. The program was established in 1968 by the ACS to help expand the career outlook of high school students from families defined as economically disadvantaged by federal poverty guidelines. Each student performs research with a mentor in an industrial or academic chemistry lab. Participating students are divided into two groups, Summer I students, participating for the first time and Summer II students, who are in their second and final summer of the program. The committee (coordinator) is expected to:

- Solicit matching funds from the local chemical community.
- Solicit scientists to act as mentors for the Project SEED Program.
