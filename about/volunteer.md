Please consider giving of your time and talent for our local
section. Feel free to contact any of the
[current officers](/about/officers.html "List of our current officers and
contact details") to indicate your interest.

Some specific volunteer needs are listed below.

**Communications Chair:** Our communications chair will be vacant as
  of January 2016.  After five years, our current chair is stepping
  down, and now would be the perfect time to step in and learn the
  ropes!  Time commitment is small, but the impact can be great. If
  you have a passion for chemistry and want to engage with the
  community to help advance chemistry education in our area, why not
  nominate yourself by contacting [Brian Eklov](/people/eklov.html).

**National Chemistry Week (NCW) Committee:** This team coordinates our
public outreach programs in celebration of National Chemistry Week
(October of each year). We usually support a community access TV
interview and cosponsor a hands-on Chemistry Day program for youth and
their families at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum (KVM). The Chemistry Day
event depends upon excellent help from the KVM staff and dozens of our
dedicated ACS members, local teachers and students, who teach and
guide participants through the activities on Chemistry Day. The NCW
committee gets things started each year and keeps it
organized. Contact [Lydia Hines](/people/hines.html)
for a more detailed list of duties.

**Section Archivist:** If you are interested in history and like to
organize and write, we would love to talk to you about updating our
Local Section History (which now goes only through 1981). Contact
[Lydia Hines](/people/hines.html) to discuss.
