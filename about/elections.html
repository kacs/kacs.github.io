      Dr. Eklov received a B.S. in Chemistry with honors from the
      University of Michigan in 1998, and a Ph.D. from the University
      of Minnesota in 2005 (T. R. Hoye).  After post-doctoral studies
      at the University of Illinois (S. E. Denmark), he joined the

      collaboration with a major pharmaceutical company to search for
      inhibitors of mTor.  He also is collaborating with a major
      chemical supplier to develop chemistry that enables academic
      discoveries to be translated into marketable reagents.

      Angela Willson may be a new WMU Graduate Teaching Assistant and

      Northern High School and then went on to attend Saint Mary's
      College and received her Bachelor of Science in Chemistry in
      2012.  At Saint Mary's College, Angela acted as co-President of
      the Saint Mary's Affiliation of the American Chemical Society
      (SMAACS).  She then spent a year in Minneapolis, MN working in
      food science with Cargill.  Most recently she has spent time in
      the area attending KACS events and volunteering for Chemistry
      Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum.
