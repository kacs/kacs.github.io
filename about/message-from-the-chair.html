<div class="col-{{ site.device }}-8">
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>
A special thank you goes out to all those who attended our Science
Café on Horticultural Chemistry and, of course, our special guest
speaker Dr. Gus Guzinski, who gave an entertaining presentation on
plant pigments at Wedels’ Nursery, Florist and Garden Center on
September 17.
</p>
<p>
It appears that October will be a busy month in the KACS schedule. We
begin with the “Sustainable Science” poster session at Bell's
Eccentric Cafe (355 E. Kalamazoo Ave) on Tuesday, October 8, 5-9
PM. The event is co-sponsored by Zoetis and features a keynote
presentation at 6 PM by Mayuri Bhakta on "Product Development at
Kellogg's" to address the history and science of cereals and chips. We
welcome attendees to mingle with local scientists from industry and
academe, including undergraduate and graduate students.
</p>
<p>
That same week, earlier than usual, we will follow up with our feature
event for National Chemistry Week (NCW), “Chemistry Day at the
Museum”, on Saturday Oct. 12, 12-4 PM at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum
downtown Kalamazoo. We invite the general public and chemists, young
and old, to celebrate this year’s theme: “Energy Now and Forever”.
</p>
<p>
KACS is not involved in organizing the following presentation, which
will likely be of great interest to some of our members. WMU hosts
Bill McKibben, who will give “Notes from the Front Lines of the
Climate Fight” on Thursday, October 10 at 7 PM at WMU’s Miller
Auditorium. The event is free but requires registration.
</p>
<p>
We hope that you will continue to check in with us to learn about the
events we are planning for our fall schedule.
