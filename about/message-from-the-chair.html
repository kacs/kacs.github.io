      As the Chairman of the Kalamazoo section for 2014 I would like
      to take this opportunity to introduce myself and tell you about
      some of the Section activities for 2014. I am John Engelmann and
      have been a member of the ACS for many years. I did my
      undergraduate work at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, and
      I got my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois.

      Our Section Councilor, Lydia Hines, and I were at the University
      of Illinois at the same time and actually worked in labs close
      together. After a number of years of going our own ways we now
      find ourselves working together in the Kalamazoo Section of the
      ACS!
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my love for chemistry I have always been
      interested in law. I got my law degree from the University of
      Illinois and found a way to combine my interests by becoming an
      Intellectual Property attorney.

      We have a number of interesting Section activities lined up for
      2014: Our January meeting will relate to food chemistry, with
      samples. In early April we are having the High School Science
      Symposium and later that month we have a small outreach in
      connection with Chemists Celebrate Earth Day. We supervise a
      competitive exam, and in May we have the Awards Gathering where
      high school teachers and students and others are recognized for
      their educational and volunteer activities. In June we will
      anticipate participating in the WMU Chemistry Graduate Student
      picnic. In October, as part of National Chemistry Week, we have
      a Saturday afternoon (Chemistry Day) at the Kalamazoo Valley
      Museum, an event in which we reach out to the community to
      encourage an interest in chemistry. Once again Zoetis is
      supporting a poster session, in October or November, where
      members can exhibit posters displaying their work â€“ it is a
      wonderful way to discover the great diversity of work being done
      by chemists of our Section. In addition to these events we will
      have meetings where we invite speakers on various topics, so
      stay tuned. You will receive meeting announcements as the date
      of each event approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please accept my personal invitation to attend some or all of
      these events, and introduce yourself to me; I look forward to
      meeting you. Greater participation makes for greater enthusiasm
      at each meeting. I would welcome any suggestions for other
      chemistry-related events you would like to see in our Section,
      so please contact me at
