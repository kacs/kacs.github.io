    <p>
      I want to begin my time as chair of the Kalamazoo Section by
      thanking everyone who volunteered at and attended our events
      over the last year. As a testament to the hard work that goes
      into the events that we host, we were rewarded with two
      ChemLuminary awards this year, one for our innovative Chemistry
      and Culture series, and the second for our Recycle-a-Poster
      event that is fast becoming a yearly tradition (Please see the
      September 2014 Newsletter for more detail). We couldn't have
      achieved these honors without your efforts and dedication.
    </p>

      This year is looking to be just as busy for the Kalamazoo
      Section. Our first large event will be the Joint Great
      Lakes/Central Regional ACS Meeting that we are co-hosting with
      the West Michigan Section this May 27-30 at DeVos Place in Grand
      Rapids. Dr. Scott Denmark (University of Illinois at
      Urbana-Champaign) will kick off the meeting as the opening
      plenary speaker, and Dr. Joan Brennecke (University of Notre
      Dame) and Dr. Dustin Mergott (Eli Lilly) will continue the
      high-level technical proceedings on Wednesday and Thursday
      afternoon.
    </p>

      Our annual awards gathering is coming up this spring, followed
      by a meeting we are planning with the Detroit and Huron Valley
      Sections in Ann Arbor this September. Chemistry Day at the
      Kalamazoo Valley Museum, a favorite event for both our section
      and me, will be in October, and planning for this year's
      Recycle-a-Poster event is already underway for November.

      I would enjoy <a href="/people/eklov.html"

	hearing from you</a> about what events you've
      enjoyed in the past, and what events you'd like to see in the
      future, and I look forward to working with you this year.
