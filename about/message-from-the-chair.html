      Happy 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary, KACS. Taking a minute to
      reflect on that accomplishment really brings home the
      realization of just how special is this group of chemists.
      Since 1942 this relatively small ACS section has established a
      strong, successful tradition of local industrial and academic,
      scientists and students, working together to share our knowledge
      and love of chemistry within Kalamazoo and beyond. Being a
      member of this organization is truly something of which to be
      proud.
    </p>

      I am grateful for the opportunity to chair our local section.
      The ACS played a key role in the start of my 32 year career as a
      pharmaceutical scientist. In 1984 as a graduating student
      member, I attended the ACS national meeting in St. Louis, and
      via the Employment Clearing House landed a position in
      Monsanto's new Bioprocess Development Group. Kalamazoo has also
      played a key role in my career. Since going to work for Upjohn
      here in 1988, and working through the Pharmacia - Pfizer -
      Zoetis changes, I've come to know Kalamazoo as an excellent
      community in which to live. Chairing our local section brings
      together an opportunity to connect and contribute to these two
      important pieces for me, Kalamazoo and the ACS, so thanks for
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with our local section's outstanding and committed
      membership and Executive Committee (who have already helped me
      immensely learn the chairing ropes), I look forward to
      continuing our already established, highly regarded activities -
      the poster and speaker sessions, Earth Day and National
      Chemistry Week events, Project SEED and more. In addition, I'll
      be looking for additional opportunities to strengthen and grow
      our local section. This is where all local section members can
      help. Please share with me and the Executive Committee any
      thoughts or ideas on what we can do to help our local section
      continue flourishing.
