    <p>
      I am honored to be the 2020 Chair of the Kalamazoo Local Section
      of the American Chemical Society. I have greatly enjoyed meeting
      many of you at KACS events the last couple of years, including
      the <em>Sustainable Science &ndash; Recycle a Poster</em>
      event, <em>Chemistry Day at the Museum</em>, <em>Kalamazoo
      National Historic Landmark Celebration</em>, 46<sup>th</sup>
      annual <em>Awards Gathering</em>, <em>Speed Networking</em>
      event, and others. These events would not be possible without
      the volunteers within our section who generously donate their
      time to make them such a success. The most important thing I can
      say is <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all the volunteers, who for
      more than three quarters of a century has made the KACS a very
      successful local section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2<sup>nd</sup> most important thing I can do is to ask for
      current members to help keep this tradition going! In my opinion
      our educational outreach is the most vital thing we do as a
      section, and for the last few years we have <b>NOT</b> had any
      members regularly serving on our education committee. I attended
      our 46<sup>th</sup> annual awards gathering on May
      6<sup>th</sup>, 2019. Awards were presented to outstanding
      graduating seniors from WMU and Kalamazoo College, a high school
      chemistry teacher highly thought of by his students, a
      distinguished KACS Volunteer and to a 60-year ACS member. In
      addition, certificates and prizes (monetary) were presented to
      outstanding high school chemistry students as determined by
      their scores on a 2-tiered examination. Unfortunately, without
      an education committee this popular program is at a very real
      risk of disappearing. We are looking for a team willing to help
      the KACS executive committee keep this tradition
      alive. <strong>If you have an interest in education or simply
      want to see the smiling faces of young people not looking at a
      screen, then I implore you to <a href="/people/jude.html"
      title="Hershel contact info">email me</a> and discuss this
      wonderful opportunity.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if anyone would like to discuss the KACS, and/or
      programs we can implement that would be of interest to the
      chemical community, or anything else, then reach out to me or
      come to our monthly executive committee meeting which is usually
      held at 6:30 pm on the third Tuesday of each month. I wish
      everyone a very successful 2020 and look forward to hearing from
      you,
    </p>
