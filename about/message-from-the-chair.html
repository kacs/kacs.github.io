    <p>
      I am pleased to serve as the 2021 Chair of the Kalamazoo Section
      of the American Chemical Society. I have over 35 years of
      pharmaceutical research and development experience and am a
      member of ACS for 47 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the benefits I have received from the ACS, I decided it
      was time to give back. In the past I given demonstrations at
      Chemistry Day and visited local elementary schools to share with
      them the excitement of science and chemistry. Last year I was
      super charged by our local section receiving the prestigious ACS
      National Historic Chemistry Landmark Award. I especially enjoyed
      the chemistry symposium on the day of the award, May 17, 2019,
      and the social event and dinner the previous evening. I wish to
      continue on the local committee to implement interesting
      scientific member meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membership enjoyment and participation, scientific meetings and
      education are my focus for this year. I hope you share with me
      or other executive members your interests and needs. Please feel
      free to <a href="/people/thomas.html">contact me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to helping the Kalamazoo ACS section achieve our
      local section's goals through successful activities and
      increased membership participation.
    </p>
