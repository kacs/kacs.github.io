      As a long time ACS fan-boy I am honored to be the 2019 chair of
      the Kalamazoo Section. We all have an over-supply of information
      of epic proportions bombarding us almost every waking
      minute. However, I am hopeful that high-quality information will
      win the attention war and that ACS will play a significant role
      in this mission. It is particularly satisfying in these times to
      be affiliated with an organization that is synonymous with
      high-quality information. I've also come to learn that amazing
      career resources and assistance are also major attractions of
      ACS. While the street-value of high-quality information is at an
      all-time low (due to an epic oversupply of low-quality
      information), it is truly remarkable how KACS's volunteers have
      kept this organization running.  To be welcomed onto this
      amazing team is humbling.

      Chemical education has long been a core objective of KACS.  In
      its heyday the KACS Education Committee was an organization in
      and of itself, with dozens of members actively engaged in
      various initiatives and subcommittees.  Fast forward to today,
      the KACS Education Committee needs to be revitalized!  If we
      don't have an educator heading up the education committee by the
      time Hershel Jude (the best chair-elect anyone could ask for!)
      takes over, I will have failed.  I don't want to be the one to
      write the KACS Education Committee eulogy, and I am open to any
      and all ideas on how to make KACS relevant and useful to
      chemical educators in our area.  Please let me know your ideas
      how best to sustain KACS' roots in chemical education.

      The KACS website has a fresh look, check it out! I'd really love
      to hear your ideas how to
      make <a href="/">kalamazooacs.org</a> the
      primary source of information for all-things-chemistry in
      Kalamazoo.  As this icy winter continues, I look forward to
      spring, and wish everyone a very productive 2019.  If you can
      only make it out for one KACS event this year, I'd recommend the
      <a href="/event/2019/05/16/chemistry-landmark-dedication.html" title="Landmark dedication page">
	Kalamazoo National Historical Chemical Landmark
	dedication</a>, (it's kind of a big deal).
