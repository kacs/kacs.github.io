    <p>
      Kalamazoo American Chemical Society Members, I look forward to
      serving as your chair during 2021. I will work closely with Ben
      Maxey, Chair-elect, Hershel Jude, Past-chair, Doug Williams,
      Treasurer, James Redwine, Secretary, Lydia Hine, Councilor, all
      the chairs of our committees and you the members to make this a
      scientifically and socially beneficial year.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goals for our section this year are three: to increase member
      participation, to continue providing interesting scientific
      activities for members and our community, and to continue
      serving as a platform for our chemists to reach out to teachers
      and students.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognize many of the activities during 2020 were postponed or
      cancelled for our section and in our own lives. As much as
      possible, activities were conducted virtually: our monthly
      executive committee meetings, award ceremonies, Project Seed,
      and Chemistry Week. It looks as though this will continue, as
      our first executive committee meeting was held virtually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our challenges for this year are several. For at least the first
      six months, we will conduct all meetings and activities
      virtually. Already the Borgess Marathon in May has been
      cancelled, and our section previously provided a water stop on
      the race. It is a challenge to have networking and socializing
      in this time of isolation and mask usage. I look for your
      suggestions to facilitate our activities. In addition, important
      committee chairs remain unfilled. The chair of the Education
      Committee, who oversees awards to teacher and students,
      administers a high school chemistry exam and conducts outreach
      to schools in Kalamazoo, Van Buren, and Allegan Counties, has
      been vacant for two years. Individuals have stepped up to keep
      most educational activities moving forward, but we need a
      greater commitment from our local section. We also have an
      opening for the chair of the Women's Chemist Committee. Please
      contact me if these two positions might be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of opportunities, I see many that lie ahead for us this
      year. We successfully conducted a Speed Networking event in
      which over 25 mentors and 25 students participated. We have been
      in touch with seven Michigan ACS Sections and have the
      opportunity to trade tips and possible seminars virtually. I
      attended the Fall 2020 ACS Meeting on-line and was impressed
      with the ease of participation and the quality of the talks. I
      expect no less from the Spring National Meeting. I encourage you
      to attend. The registration fee is $99 for members, $29 for
      students, and free for retirees. We have the opportunity to host
      speakers monthly via Zoom. A pilot meeting in the fall, a
      recognition event for Lydia Hines, proved quite successful in
      having the section participate virtually. Hopefully with
      vaccinations, mask wearing and social distancing, we will be
      able to return to some kind of normal in the fall. This could
      include Chemistry Week, Recycle a Poster, and other activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very excited about serving as your chair, and meeting new
      people. We will build on our section's past successes and have
      many positive moments to reflect on by the end of the year!
    </p>
