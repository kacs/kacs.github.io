  <h3>Message from the KACS Chair</h3>
  <p>Dear Readers,</p>
  <p>I thank all the volunteers who helped make recent KACS Education events a success: the <em>High School Chemistry Symposium</em> on April 30 and the annual <em>Awards Ceremony</em> on May 20. A special thank you goes to Dr. James Kiddle (WMU), the KACS Chair of the Education Subcommittee in charge of identifying outstanding High School chemistry students through the competitive exams process.</p>

  <p>There is a special call for volunteers for <strong><em>Chemistry Day at the Museum</em></strong> scheduled for October 12. <strong>We need you!</strong> Please contact Dr. Lydia Hines (<a href="mailto:lemhwgh@gmail.com?subject=Chemistry Day at the Museum">lemhwgh@gmail.com</a>) <strong>as soon as possible</strong>. KACS also needs to identify officers for our upcoming joint regional meeting in 2015 as outlined on page 2 of the July newsletter.</p>
  <p>Also find out why you should mark your calendar for a <strong>party on Tuesday, September 10</strong> at the Westin Indianapolis Hotel.</p>
  <p>We hope that you will continue to check in with us to learn about the events we are planning for our fall schedule.</p>
  July 11, 2013</p>
