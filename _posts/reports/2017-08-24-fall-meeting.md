## Other Council Actions

### Amendments to the ACS Bylaws

A recommendation by the Committee on Membership Affairs that Council
approve the Petition on International Chemical Sciences Chapters
**narrowly failed to achieve the two-thirds majority required to amend
the Bylaws**. The proposal would have amended Bylaw IX, Section 4, to
permit financial support for International Chemical Sciences Chapters
and to remove language from the Bylaws prohibiting Chapters from
having representation on Council.

### Probationary Division of Space Chemistry

The Council **defeated** a proposal from the Committee on Divisional
Activities that it establish a **probationary Division of Space
Chemistry**, effective January 1, 2018.

### Change in Local Section Territory

On the recommendation of the Committee on Local Section Activities,
the Council approved a petition from the South Jersey Local Section to
annex the unassigned and adjacent territory of Ocean County, New
Jersey.

## Highlights from Committee Reports

### Nominations and Elections

**Ballots for the 2017 fall national election** will be distributed on
September 29, with a voting deadline four weeks later, on October
27. In a change of procedures, all members with an email address on
file and eligible to vote will receive an **electronic ballot** with
the option to request a paper ballot. Those members with no email
address on file will be sent a paper ballot with the option to still
vote electronically. The ACS election vendor, Survey &amp; Ballot
Systems, will send three email reminders during the voting period to
those who have not voted as of the reminder date.

statements and IRS 990 filings.

### Washington Meeting Attendance

The theme of the 254th ACS National Meeting was "Chemistry's Impact on
the Global Economy".

# Actions of the Board of Directors
## The Board's Executive Session

At this meeting, the ACS Board of Directors considered a number of key
strategic issues and responded with several actions.

On the recommendation of the Society Committee on Budget and Finance,
the Board voted to **approve the advance member registration fee for
national meetings held in 2018 at $475; and to authorize two new
program funding requests: (a) an ACS Online Course in Laboratory
Safety, and (b) a New Faculty Workshop Series**.

### The Executive Director/CEO Report

The Executive Director/CEO and his direct reports provided updates to
the Board on the activities of Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and
the ACS Publications Division. He offered current and proposed
strategies to increase membership in the Society; reported on safety
initiatives, resources and security; and provided an update on the
Atlantic Basin Conference on Chemistry (ABCChem) scheduled for January
2018.

As part of his report, he emphasized that membership recruitment is
everyone's responsibility, and that an increase in the recruitment of
members from the industrial sector must be a priority; mention was
made of increasing efforts in cyber-security with specific mention of
the unacceptable activities of SciHub and ResearchGate.

### Other Society Business

The Board also held a discussion with officers and members of the
board of directors of the National Organization for the Professional
Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) on what
governance participation might look like at the organizations' annual
meetings, possible meetings between ACS and NOBCChE at the ACS
Leadership Institute, dual membership between both organizations,
strategic alliances of student chapters at the local section and
regional levels, and ACS Board participation at NOBCChE Annual
Conferences.
