# Reports of Elected Committees (Highlights)
## Council Policy (CPC)

As required by the Society's Bylaws, CPC has set the divisors which
will be used to determine how many Councilors each Local Section and
Division is entitled for 2016-2019. Official notification will be
sent to Local Sections and Divisions by April 15 in order to
accommodate the conduct of their elections in 2015. CPC's Long Range
Planning Subcommittee is forming a task force to consider whether
changes are in order for the calculations and policies, and to
implement any recommendations in time for the 2020 election cycle.

# Reports of Society Committees (Highlights)
## Education (SOCED)

A subcommittee is working on developing &ldquo;Learning Outcomes&rdquo; for
Chemistry I, by the Fall of 2016; 2015 chair of SOCED is Diane Krone.

SOCED reported that more than 1,900 individuals have joined the
American Association of Chemistry Teachers (AACT) which launched last
year, 88 percent of whom are K-12 teachers of chemistry. The Dow
Chemical Company was announced as the Sole Founding Partner of AACT
with a gift of $1 million.

## Science (ComSci) ComSci has collaborated with several ACS
committees to develop five public policy statements which were
approved by the Board in December 2014. More recently ComSci led the
development of a new draft ACS policy statement on hydraulic
fracturing, which will be considered by the Board. Current
collaborations include revising ACS policy statements on energy,
climate change and forensic science.

# Reports of Standing Committees (Highlights)

## Committee on Meetings and Expositions (M&amp;E)

M&amp;E recommends that the Early Member Registration Fee for 2016
national meetings be $415.

As part of the continuing ACS sustainability effort and to encourage
the use of the ACS mobile app and online program, M&amp;E has decided
to discontinue free distribution of the hard copy program book
starting in 2016. Those who pre-register for the meeting may purchase
a copy of the program book for $10 (pick up on site), and copies will
be available at the meeting for $20. The PDF version of the national
meeting program will be more prominently displayed on the ACS website
for those who would like to print portions for themselves.

M&amp;E reported on the attendance as of Tuesday evening, March 24:

<table>
 <tr><td>Attendees</td><td>7,307</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Students</td><td>5,141</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Exhibitors</td><td>847</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Expo only</td><td>360</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Guest</td><td>285</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Total</td><td>13,940</td></tr>
</table>

## Committee on Divisional Activities (DAC)

National meeting attendees were recently surveyed for their views on
the Society's policy governing the use of devices to capture and/or
disseminate content delivered at our meetings. While expressing
support for the policy, the respondents also expressed interest in
amending the current policy to permit presenters &ndash; at their discretion
&ndash; to authorize audience members to capture and disseminate
content. &ldquo;Steps are being taken&rdquo; to improve the MAPS, the
Abstract Submission system.


## Committee on Local Section Activities (LSAC)

LSAC is continuing to offer a mini-grant to Local Sections that
attended the 2015 Leadership Institute to partner with neighboring
sections to host an activity that would bring value to all members in
a specific region. The committee is also planning to fund 16 grants
totaling $4000 for the Bridging the Gap: Teachers of Chemistry K-12
Nano-Grants. More information about all LSAC grants, and those of
other committees, is available at www.acs.org/getinvolved. 146/185
Local Sections submitted their Annual Reports by the deadline of
February 15.

## Committee on Membership Affairs (MAC)

MAC approved a recommendation from staff to ask individuals who have
been receiving the 50 percent Graduate Student Discount for four years
or more if they are still graduate students, so they can receive the
correct dues renewal. The current [honor system] process does not
provide an opportunity for graduate students to change their status
after graduation except by contacting ACS Member Services.

***MAC has endorsed President Diane Schmidt's campaign to invite
faculty from PhD granting U.S. institutions to give ACS membership as
an award to outstanding students in chemistry. Schmidt will match each
gift by paying a student's membership from her Presidential funds.***

## Committee on Economic and Professional Affairs (CEPA)

CEPA reported the 2014 New Graduate Survey Results which show the
unemployment rate for new graduate chemists has dropped from 14.9
percent in the 2013 survey to 12.4 percent as of 2014. The drop is
principally due to more new bachelor's degree chemists finding
employment. ACS members experienced three successive years of lowered
unemployment, which could hint at a positive outlook for chemists in
coming years. While unemployment is down, salaries have been overall
stagnant.

# Reports of Other Committees (Highlights)

## Professional Training (CPT)

There are currently 681 colleges and universities offering
ACS-approved bachelor's degree programs in chemistry.

The new 2015 ACS Guidelines for Bachelor's Degree Programs were
approved at CPT's winter meeting and recently published on the ACS
website.

## Environmental Improvement (CEI)

At this meeting CEI awarded Local Section Sustainability Grants to
three Local Sections: Cornell, Kalamazoo, and Midland.

The committee and the Division of Environmental Chemistry have jointly
established a project to provide grant support for programming around
climate change at regional meetings.

# Actions of the Board of Directors
## The Board's Executive Session

On the recommendation of the Society Committee on Education (SOCED),
the Board voted to approve a procedure for the establishment of the
inaugural Governing Board for the American Association of Chemistry
Teachers (AACT).

## Other Society Business

As part of its ongoing commitment to consider the most important
strategic issues facing the Society, the Board held a discussion on
improving governance agility.
