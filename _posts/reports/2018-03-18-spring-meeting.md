# 255th ACS National Meeting

<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

## Candidates for President-Elect, 2019

The Committee on Nominations and Elections presented to the Council
the following nominees for selection as candidates for
President-Elect, 2019: **Harmon B. Abrahamson**, **Luis
A. Echegoyen**, **Thomas R. Gilbert**, and **Mary Virginia Orna**.  By
electronic ballot, the Council selected **Luis A. Echegoyen** and
**Thomas R. Gilbert** as **candidates for 2019 President-Elect**.

## Board of Director Candidates for Districts I and V

By internet ballot, the Councilors selected **John E. Adams** and
**Joseph A. Heppert** as District V candidates. Ballots will be
distributed on or before October 1 to all ACS members in District V
for election of a Director from the District.

## Candidates for Directors-at-Large

The Committee on Nominations and Elections announced the selection of
the following **candidates for Directors-at-Large** for 2019-2021
terms: **Frank D. Blum**, **Lee H. Latimer**, **Ingrid Montes**, and
**Angela W. Peters**. The election of two Directors-at-Large from
among these four candidates and any selected via petition will be
conducted in the fall.  Ballots will be distributed to the Council on
or before October 1, 2018.

## Amendments to the ACS Bylaws

The Council approved Petition on the Composition of Society Committees
[Bylaw III, Sec. 3, e, (3), (4), and (8)], which will change the
requirement for Councilors on Society Committees from at least two
thirds (2/3) to a majority, and remove the requirement that the Chair
and Vice-Chair of a Society Committee must be Councilors.

The Petition for Election of Committee Chairs [Bylaw III, Sec. 3, c,
(1); d, 3, (3), (8); e, (3), (8); g, (3); i (3)], which would allow
the voting members of all ACS committees to select their own Chairs,
failed to gain the approval of Council.

## 2019 Member Dues 

The Council voted on the recommendation of the Committee on Budget and
Finance to set the member **dues for 2019 at the fully escalated rate
of $175**. This rate is established pursuant to an
inflation-adjustment formula in the ACS Constitution and Bylaws.

## Distribution Formula for Division Funding

The proposed formula for allocating dues funds to divisions,
recommended by the Committee on Divisional Activities, was recommitted
to the committee.

## Continuation of Committees

The Council approved the recommendation of the Committee on Committees
that the Committee on Ethics be continued; and that the committees on
Publications and on Younger Chemists be continued contingent on
approval by the Board of Directors.

## Education

The American Association of Chemistry Teachers (AACT) now has 5000
members, 90% of whom are grade 9-12 teachers and about 200 are from
schools outside the US.

## Highlights from Committee Reports

### Budget and Finance

In 2017, ACS generated a Net from Operations of $28.6 million, which
was $4.8 million higher than 2016. Total revenues were $553.1 million,
increasing 5.0% or $26.4 million over 2016. Expenses ended the year at
$524.5 million, which was $21.6 million or 4.3% higher than prior
year.  This was attributable to strong performance from the Societyâ€™s
Information Service units (CAS and ACS Publications) and a continued
emphasis on expense management across the ACS.

### Membership

The ACS ended 2017 with over 150,000 members.  This number represents
a continuing decline in overall membership for the sixth year in a
row.  The Committee on Membership Affairs is committed to working with
Council, the Board of Directors, the Committee on Budget and Finance,
ACS staff, and other stakeholders to halt this trend and return ACS to
a growing and engaged membership.  Initiatives are being taken to
increase the perceived value of membership which is becoming
increasingly global in nature.

## The Executive Director/CEO Report 

The Board received an extensive report from the Executive Director and
CEO on issues relating to the Safety and Professionalism core values
of the Society as well as on Membership, ACS financial performance,
Operational Excellence, and upcoming events and activities. His direct
reports then engaged in discussions with the Board on the activities,
opportunities and challenges of the Education Division, Chemical
Abstracts Service (CAS), and the ACS Publications Division.
  
## Board Resolution

Finally, the Board approved a resolution that recognizes and applauds
the **United Nations for proclaiming 2019 as the International Year of
the Periodic Table**, and pledged that the Society will do its utmost
to recognize and participate in events celebrating this important
scientific milestone and achievement.

## The Board's Regular (Open) Session

The Board held a well-attended open session on March 18, which
featured a presentation from Dr. Lisa M. Balbes (Balbes Consultants,
LLC) on *Nontraditional Careers in Chemistry: Thinking Outside the
Beaker*. She also introduced two alumni from the ACS Scholars Program,
Brandon Presley and Isa Watson, who briefly shared their careers paths
to date with the assembled audience.
