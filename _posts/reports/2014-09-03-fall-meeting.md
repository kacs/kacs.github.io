Reports of Society Committees and Committee on Science (Highlights)
===

Education (SOCED)
---
SOCED received an update on the new American Association of Chemistry
Teachers (AACT), which is now accepting members and will officially
launch September 2, 2014. Membership is open to anyone with an
interest in chemistry education. Member benefits include access to
curricular resources, such as lesson plans and multimedia;
professional development opportunities; a subscription to ChemMatters;
and an online member network. There is a membership fee of $50.00 to
join the AACT and Local Sections were encouraged to offer memberships
to teachers as awards. The website is www.teachchemistry.org

Science (ComSci)
---
ComSci remains focused on three areas: increasing understanding of the
emerging frontiers in science, recommending eminent chemical
scientists for prestigious external awards, and developing public
policies to advance science in society. ComSci has identified two
multidisciplinary areas that hold great promise for fostering
innovation and opportunities for chemistry-related scientists:
advanced materials and the chemistry of clean and renewable
energy. ComSci has also completed four on-demand video interviews with
Nobel Laureates and other celebrated scientists, which will be linked
with the onsite emerging science forums in 2015.

Reports of Standing Committees (Highlights)
===

Economic and Professional Affairs (CEPA)
---
CEPA announced that the unemployment rate for all ACS chemists has
dropped from 3.5% in March 2013 to 2.9% as of March 2014. However, the
unemployment rate for new chemistry graduates as of August 2013 is
considered to be an all-time high of 14.6%. The number is higher when
we isolate bachelor’s level graduates, for whom the rate is 15.8%.

On the recommendation of CEPA, Council VOTED to approve the
Professional Employment Guidelines.

Committee on Meetings and Expositions (M&E)
---
M&E reported that 11,847 papers were accepted for the 248th National
Meeting in San Francisco.  As of August 13, total attendance was
15,761. The Committee voted to recommend to the Board of Directors the
following sites for National Meetings:

- Boston – Fall 2024, 2029, 2031
- San Diego – Spring 2025, 2031, and Fall 2027
- New Orleans – Spring 2027, 2032
- Chicago – Fall 2022

The Committee heard an update on the Meeting Abstracts Programming
System (MAPS). The new system will launch August 25 in preparation for
the Denver National Meeting. Regional Meetings and specialty
conferences will use MAPS starting in January 2015.

The Fall 2016 National ACS Meeting in Philadelphia, PA will likely be
held August 25-31 instead of the currently scheduled August 21-25 due
to a possible conflict with the dates of the Democratic National
Convention.

M&E has voted to strengthen the current recording policy at National
Meetings by including enforcement language. Failure to follow the
policy could result in disciplinary action up to and including
expulsion from the meeting.

Divisional Activities (DAC)
---
DAC is conducting a pilot program with the ACS Presentations on Demand
Coordinating Editor regarding a new type of recorded meeting content –
three- to five-minute videos (ACS POD Shorts) that focus on the most
notable aspects of a full-length presentation. DAC is developing a
process to more readily permit divisions to benefit from one another’s
innovations.

The Multidisciplinary Program Planning Group (MPPG) is proposing the
following 2018-2019 National Meeting themes to the divisions for their
consideration:

2018

- Spring – Energy Solutions and the Environment
- Fall – Chemistry – from Bench to Market

2019

- Spring – Chemistry for New Frontiers

Committee on Local Section Activities (LSAC)
---

LSAC will award 14 Innovative Project Grants (IPG) totaling $30,033,
bringing the 2014 total to 33 IPG awards totaling over $70,000. LSAC
will also be offering grants during the fall to assist local sections
with hosting a strategic planning retreat; a Leadership Development
System course in their section, and to assist with travel to the 2015
ACS Leadership Institute.

The 2015 Leadership Institute will be held in Dallas, Texas, in late
January (January 23-25).

Only 178/186 Local Sections had submitted Annual Reports by the time
