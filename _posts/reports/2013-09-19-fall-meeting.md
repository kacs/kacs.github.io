Realignment of Electoral Districts
---
ACS Bylaws require that the six electoral districts – from which six
directors are elected to the ACS Board of Directors – be balanced in
their total member populations. The Council voted to approve a
proposal by the Committee on Nominations and Elections to realign
these districts. The realignment meets the specified criteria for
redistricting as required by Bylaw V, Section 4a and brings all six
districts within permissible population range. **This change does not
affect the 2013 election for District Director.**

Committee Reports (Highlights)
===
Committee on Committees (ConC)
---
ConC recognized Councilors for service on Council and on the various
Committees. Our Councilor was recognized for **30 years** of Service.

Society Committee on Education (SOCED)
---
SOCED recognized the achievement that is present in the **Next
Generation Science Standards**, including their basis in research on
teaching and learning, their formulation as performance standards, and
their basis in the NRC framework and its dimensions of Science and
Engineering Practices, Disciplinary Core Ideas, and Cross Cutting
Concepts. SOCED supported the Standards as a document that is broadly
applicable as a basis for K-12 science instruction and called on the
Society to develop innovative programming to support the
implementation of the Standards.

Committee on Economic and Professional Affairs (CEPA)
---
CEPA reported that employment is up and unemployment is down for ACS
chemists. The complete review of the Comprehensive Salary Survey will
appear in the September 23 issue of *C&EN*.

Committee on Project SEED
---
During the Summer of 2013 444 students were served in more than 100
laboratories (3 were served locally by members of the KACS at WMU)

Meeting Registration Report
---
As of the morning of September 11, 2013, the ACS fall national meeting
had attracted 10,840 registrants, including 6,630 regular attendees
and 2,584 students.

Divisions
---
After much debate, a proposed **name change** for the *Division of Colloid
and Surface Chemistry* to the *Division of Colloids, Surfaces, and
Nanomaterials* was defeated by the Council in a close vote.

Special Discussion Item
---

A special discussion item was put on the Council agenda for this
meeting. ACS President Marinda Wu presented and moderated a
discussion on “What can we – as the Society and as individual citizens
– do to help create jobs or demand for chemists?” She shared five
recommendations from the presidential task force “Vision 2025: Helping
ACS Members to Thrive in the Global Chemistry Enterprise” and what
they might imply for our efforts to help create jobs: discover and
share information about the skills and competencies that a wide range
of employers will need; continue to expand resources which help our
members to position themselves for successful careers in the global
chemistry enterprise; enable entrepreneurs to create and strengthen
their startups that hire chemistry professionals; advocate for
policies that improve the business climate and promote the creation of
chemistry jobs; and work with other stakeholders to understand and
influence the supply and demand of chemists and jobs. Following the
presentation, numerous Councilors engaged in a discussion of this
focused topic on possibilities to encourage jobs creation and offered
several suggestions.

Actions of the Board of Directors
===
The Board held a lengthy strategic issue discussion on the topic
“Connecting Chemists with Each Other.” It considered what the role of
ACS should be in helping chemists develop relationships with other
chemists and the strategies that enable those relationships; how these
strategies encourage and support younger and international members;
and how these strategies develop relationships to leverage the
world-renowned chemists/innovators that comprise our membership.

The Board received a briefing and approved a recommendation from its
Committee on Executive Compensation. The compensation of the Society’s
executive staff receives regular review from the Board. **Executive
compensation is considered appropriate if it is around ¾ of the
average compensation at comparable non-profit+for-profit
organizations.**

The Board confirmed the recommendation of the ACS Executive
Director/CEO of the new President of Chemical Abstracts Service
(CAS). He is Manuel (Manny) Guzman, most recently Executive Vice
President of Learning and Research Solutions of Cengage
Learning. Mr. Guzman succeeds Robert J, Massie, who is retiring after
leading CAS with great distinction and success for 21 years and is
retiring in March 2014.
