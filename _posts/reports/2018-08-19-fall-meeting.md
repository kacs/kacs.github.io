### Special Discussion

President Dorhout introduced and led a special discussion on what
role(s) ACS should play in preventing sexual harassment in the
sciences. He highlighted several recent articles, workshops and
studies that have called attention to the issue, notably a symposium,
*Science of Sexual Harassment* organized during the ACS National
Meeting in New Orleans (Spring 2018) by the Women Chemists Committee
and Chemical & Engineering News; and a National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine consensus study report: *Sexual Harassment
of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine* (2018). He directed Council's attention to
existing ACS codes and initiatives to address sexual harassment, and
offered items for discussion and possible action:

- More signs/information at National Meetings regarding our policies and supporting information
- Trained volunteers at national meetings for reporting sexual harassment
- A webinar on preventing sexual harassment for local sections or divisions

To further inform the discussion and Councilor input, a **brief survey
was conducted** using the audience electronic response system. The
**results of the survey are listed below**. The ACS Volunteer/National
Meeting Attendee Conduct Policy can be found

### Highlights from Committee Reports

#### Nominations and Elections

The Committee on Nominations and Elections solicits Councilors' input
of qualified individuals for President-Elect and/or Directors for
future consideration. Suggestions can be sent to
[nomelect@acs.org](mailto:nomelect@acs.org).

**Ballots for the 2018 fall national election will be distributed
October 1-3, with a voting deadline four weeks later, on October
31**. ACS members eligible to vote and with an email address on file
will receive an *electronic ballot* with the option to request a paper
ballot. Those members with no email address on file will be sent a
paper ballot but with the option to vote electronically. The ACS
election vendor, Survey & Ballot Systems, will send three email
reminders during the voting period to those who have not voted as of
the reminder date.

#### Budget and Finance

The Committee considered one 2019 program funding reauthorization
request, and on its recommendation, the Board subsequently approved
funding the *ACS Festival Series* for inclusion in the 2019 Proposed
Budget and the 2020-2021 Forecast Budgets. The Society is expected to
end the year in compliance with each of the five Board-established
financial guidelines. Additional information can be found at
[acs.org](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/aboutacs/financial.html).

#### Boston Meeting Attendance

The theme of the 256th ACS National Meeting was *Nanoscience,
Nanotechnology, and Beyond.* As of Tuesday evening, August 21,
attendance was **14,235**.

#### Membership Affairs

As of August 21, **ACS had 149,584 members**, which is a decline of
only eight-tenths of one percent from the over 150,000 members in 2017.
This year-to-date figure represents an increase of over 1,200
members when compared to the last two years. It was noted that five of
last seven months have been respectively the best months for
membership since at least 2014. The current membership count positions
ACS for a strong close to the year, and there is cautious optimism
that total membership will rise for the first time since 2011.

## Actions of the Board of Directors

### The Board's Executive Session

#### The Board's Committees 

The Board of Directors received and discussed reports from its
committees on Corporation Associates, Professional and Member
Relations, Executive Compensation, the Governing Board for Publishing,
and the Society Committee on Budget and Finance.  On the basis of
those reports and with regard to the Board's strategic vision for the
Society:

- The Board approved, on the recommendation of the Committee on
  Professional and Member Relations, the Society's nominees for the
  2019 Perkin Medal and the 2019 National Science Board Public Service
  Award.
- The Board voted to approve the appointments or reappointments of
  several editors-in-chief for ACS journals as recommended by the
  Joint Board-Council Committee on Publications and Editor Selection
  Committees. Information about those appointments will appear in
  C&amp;EN once the individuals concerned have been notified.
- In light of the recent financial performance of the
  technical-meeting component of our national meetings, **the Board
  voted to approve an advance member registration fee of $490 for
  national meetings held in 2019 (i.e., the current advance member
  registration fee escalated to account for inflation only); to
  reauthorize a program funding request for the Chemistry Festival
  program**; and in accordance with past practice, to allocate on a
  pro-rated basis to qualified ACS Divisions any net revenues accrued
  to the Society from the 2020 and future International Chemical
  Congresses of the Pacific Basin Societies (Pacifichem).
- The Board expressed **support for the value of industry to ACS** and
  acknowledged Corporation Associates as being positioned within the
  Society to represent the voice of industry to the Board and ACS.
- The Board's Society Programs global liaison offered an update on
  **efforts to strengthen the global presence of Society programs to
  better serve our international members and the global chemistry
  enterprise**. Efforts are underway to clarify and articulate the
  current state of international activities, products, and services;
  to clarify the challenges associated with globalization of existing
  domestic activities; and to offer recommendations for moving
  forward. Next steps include interviewing key stakeholders, reviewing
  past efforts, and exploiting existing market research with a view
  toward developing a strategic plan, activities, and timelines for
  Board consideration.
- The Board liaison to the Leadership Advisory Board (LAB) provided an
  update on initial **efforts geared towards the development of a
  next-generation ACS Leadership Program**. A small task force has been
  charged with investigating the state of the art in leadership
  development, assessing the future needs of the Society as well as
  those of individual members and their employers, and then proposing,
  by the end of 2019, a strategic vision for and the specifications of
  a next-generation ACS leadership program focused on 2030 and beyond.

#### Other Society Business 

The Board approved the foundation documents of the newly created
endowment for the Henry H. Storch Award in Energy Chemistry, which
originally was established as a national award in 1964.

### The Board's Regular Session

The Board held a well-attended regular session on Sunday, August 19,
that featured a presentation by Nobel Laureate Sir Fraser Stoddart who
spoke on transformative research and reviewed his contributions in
supramolecular chemistry and molecular recognition. Also, as a
Champion of the program, he advocated for ACS Project SEED on the 50th
Anniversary of the program.
