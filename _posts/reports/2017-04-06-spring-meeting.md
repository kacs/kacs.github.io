# Actions of the Council

As has been the custom for the past several years, ACS hosted and
Outreach Event just prior to the meeting in San Francisco , on April
1. It was my pleasure to help at that event where we saw many families
come by to explore science topics and receive the plentiful materials
our professional organization makes available.

The Council selected Bonnie A. Charpentier and Willie E. May as
**candidates for 2018 President-Elect**. These two candidates, along with
any candidates selected via petitions, will stand for election in the
Fall 2017 National Election.

Our **Kalamazoo Section was recognized** for its 75th anniversary

A recommendation by the Council Policy Committee to approve the
Petition for the Removal of Officers and Councilors (Bylaw III,
Sec. 1, i; Bylaw VII, Sec. 1, c; Bylaw VIII, Sec. 4, d) failed.

The Council voted to **set the member dues for 2018 at the fully
escalated rate of $171**. This rate is established pursuant to an
inflation-adjustment formula in the ACS Constitution and Bylaws.

On the recommendation of the Committee on Local Section Activities,
the Council approved a petition from the Santa Clara Valley Local
Section in California to change the name of the section to the Silicon
Valley Local Section.

The **Committee on Nominations and Elections** (of which I am a member)
solicits Councilors’ input of qualified individuals for
President-Elect and/or Directors for future consideration.
Suggestions may be sent to nomelect@acs.org. This Committee works
diligently to find excellent people to recommend for positions on
committees and the Board. At this Spring meeting we deliberated for a
minimum of 25 hours outside of the council meeting which, for
committee members, starts at 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning
 
As of December 31, 2016, the **ACS membership was 156,129**, which is
0.5% less than on the same date in 2015. The number of new members who
joined in 2016 is 23,700. The Society’s **overall retention rate is
83.5%**. The Committee on Membership Affairs also reported that the
**number of international members has increased to 27,388, exceeding
the committee’s target by 5%**. Retention of graduate students
increased by 2% to 76.2%.

## Special Discussion

The Council conducted a special discussion, *ACS Yesterday and Today:
Paving the Way to Tomorrow*, to gather input for the Joint Board-CPC
Task Force on Governance Design. Forty Councilors approached the
floor microphones to share observations, comments, and suggestions to
assist the task force in identifying opportunities and issues for
governance improvement. The task force offered three questions to
guide the discussion: What should the Society and its governance do
differently to achieve its objects? If you could change one thing
about ACS governance, what would it be? What should the task force
leave as is?

The Board of Directors is developing a statement based on the
Society’s Core Value of diversity and inclusion in response to the
repeal of the North Carolina law known as House Bill 2 ("bathroom
bill") and similar proposed legislation in Texas, and is assembling a
representative group of stakeholders to advise it on actions relating
to the location of Society meetings.

The Board passed a resolution expressing appreciation to Denise
L. Creech for her 27 years of service in the Membership and Scientific
Advancement Division, which she led as director for nearly 14 years.

Note: I appreciate the opportunity to serve our Section as your
councilor and am always available to facilitate your contact with ACS.
