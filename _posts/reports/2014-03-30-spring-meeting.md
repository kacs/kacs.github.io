Committee Reports
===
- **Education (SOCED)**
  - SOCED approved a pilot program to form ACS International Student Chapters.
  - The American Association of Chemistry Teachers (AACT) – the first of its kind - will be ready for teacher participation in September of this year; members of this subgroup will not be ACS members (thought they are free to join) but will have access to educational offerings of the Society.
- **Economic and Professional Affairs (CEPA)**
  - Findings from the ACS 2013 New Graduate Survey have been compiled and reveal troubling news: overall unemployment among new graduates rose from 12.6% in 2012 to 14.9% in 2013. This is primarily due to the high unemployment among recent Bachelors. New graduates must be at the top of our priority list for employment assistance in 2014.

  - As of the morning of March 19, 2014, this national meeting had attracted 13,680 registrants, including 6,853 regular attendees and 5,140 students.  The meeting had 10,050 papers presented.  
  - The new ACS Mobile Application had over 6,000 downloads by meeting attendees.
- **Divisional Activities (DAC)**
  - Operating as a DAC subcommittee, the Multidisciplinary Planning Group is proposing the following **2017 national meeting themes** to the divisions for their consideration:
    - Spring, San Francisco: *Advanced Materials, Technologies, Systems and Processes*
    - Fall, Washington, DC: *Chemistry’s Impact on the Global Economy*
- **Local Section Activities (LSAC)**
  - LSAC will initiate the process to dissolve the Ocean County (New Jersey) Section as a result of the group’s failure to meet the criteria to remain an active section.
- **Chemical Safety (CCS)**
  - CCS has published its first-ever **Safety Alert** concerning the **Rainbow Demonstration**, in *Chemical and Engineering News*, March 17, 2014. Copies were distributed to Councilors with a request that the information be distributed as widely as possible to High School teachers – Our Kalamazoo Section teachers have been forwarded the information.
- **Chemists with Disabilities (CWD)**
  - The committee has updated and digitized its publication *Teaching Chemistry to Students with Disabilities.*  It will be available in April 2014 and linked to the CWD website.
- **Community Activities (CCA)**
  - Copies of the publication *Celebrating Chemistry – The Wonder of Water*, a product of the ACS Department of Volunteer Support in conjunction with CCA, were distributed to Councilors. Local Sections can order up to 750 copies of this publication for Chemists Celebrate Earth Day.

Actions of the Board of Directors
===
- The Board held a discussion on operational issues relating to virtual versus face-to-face committee meetings, the appropriate detail and format of information presented to the Board and committee members, and the proper length of committee meetings.
- The Executive Director/CEO and her direct reports updated the Board on the ACS financial trends and near term outlook; the launch of the recently approved American Association of Chemistry Teachers, which will support K-12 teachers of chemistry by providing them with a professional home that addresses and is responsive to their needs; and the activities and plans of CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) and the ACS Publications Division.
- The Board expressed its gratitude and thanks to **Madeleine Jacobs**, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, who on March 6 **announced her plan to retire** at the end of the year. 
- The Board held a lively, well-attended open session which featured a special forum focused on the question:  “What is the one thing you like that ACS does, and why?” Members attending the session also received a brief review of the questions posed at the spring 2013 Board Open Session in New Orleans and the follow-ups undertaken by governance and staff.  Board members continue to be pleased by the new format, turnout and quality of the discussions.
