The Council meeting was held virtually due to the ongoing global
COVID-19 pandemic that continues to affect our personal lives and our
work. Councilors were urged to take into account their own actions and
habits to make their own communities safer. Councilors were advised to
use their positions as members of the scientific enterprise to spread
helpful messages and encourage the safe practice of mask wearing,
physical distancing, and limiting exposure within your communities.

The continuous and ongoing struggle in this country to create a safe
and equitable society for all was brought to Council’s attention. The
ACS encourages inclusivity and opposes discrimination in scientific
learning and practice. Councilors were urged to take active roles in
dismantling any barriers that may deter or impede their colleagues in
their research or careers. Councilors and guests were encouraged to
review the ACS statements on diversity and reflect on how to implement
these in their local sections and divisions.

# Actions of the Board of Directors

## The Board's Executive Session

The ACS Board of Directors met in Executive Session on August 13 and
21, 2002, and focused on a number of key strategic issues and took
several related actions.

### The Board's Committees

The Board received and discussed reports from its committees on Budget
and Finance, Executive Compensation, Publications, Pensions and
Investments, Professional and Member Relations, and its Governing
Board for Publishing, which included the activities, opportunities,
and challenges of the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and the ACS
Publications Division.

On the recommendation of the Committee on Professional and Member
Relations, the Board voted to approve the Society's nominees for the
2021 National Science Board Public Service Award and the 2021 Perkin
Medal. The Board also approved changes in the selection criteria for
the Priestley Medal, the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award, and the Award
for Volunteer Service to the ACS, as well as revisions to the National
Awards Code of Conduct Confirmation statement.

The Board approved an amendment to the Board Regulations on the duties
of the Committee on Professional and Member Relations to include
"monitoring, assessing, and facilitating the Society's progress on
Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect."

The Board received a briefing and approved recommendations from its
Committee on Executive Compensation stemming from a recent executive
salary benchmarking study. The compensation of the Society's executive
staff continues to be reviewed regularly by the Board.

### Chief Executive Officer's Report

The Board received an extensive report from the CEO on issues relating
to Safety and Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect as core values of the
Society, as well as on the continued response of the Society to the
COVID-19 pandemic, ACS membership, ACS financial performance, and
upcoming events and activities.

### Other Society Business

The Board heard reports from the three members of the **Presidential
Succession** on their current activities, as well as those planned for
2020-21, particularly the presidential symposia and endorsed symposia
for Fall 2020 Virtual National Meeting.

The Board held a **strategic discussion** on ways to turn the **ACS
Core Value of Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect**, one of the most
important strategic issues facing the Society today, into a
prioritized action plan for the coming years. The development of such
a plan would be undertaken in collaboration with the Advisory Board on
Diversity, Inclusion and Respect and would promote the coordination of
committee activities so as to emphasize the urgency of "moving the
needle" both within ACS and in the broader chemistry enterprise.

The debrief noted above provided a lead-in to and context for a status
update from the **Task Force on the Future of Meetings**. This task
force has been charged with performing a "deep dive" on the current
portfolio of ACS meetings and conferences, identifying current
offerings, evaluating governance and staff support structures, revenue
streams, financial targets, and business models, and recommending
actions that will ensure the sustainability and future relevance of
that portfolio.

### Board Approval of Council Action

The Board of Directors voted to confirm the amendments to Bylaw XI,
per the Petition to Clarify Amendments to the Standing Rules approved
by Council on August 19.

The Board of Directors voted to confirm the disbanding of the Joint
Board-Council Committee on Chemical Abstracts Service in accordance
with Council action on August 19.

The Board of Directors voted to authorize the formation of the Israel
International Chemical Sciences Chapter in accordance with Council
action on August 19.
