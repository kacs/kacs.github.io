The Kalamazoo area has always been historically rich with exciting
chemistry. Please join us and share the area’s wealth of exciting
chemistry by bringing a poster of your chemistry accomplishments. Your
poster can either be newly prepared or a recycled poster from a
previous event. This Mixer invites local academic and industrial
chemists from all areas of chemistry: Analytical, Biochemistry,
Inorganic, Organic, and Physical, in addition to Food and Medicinal
Chemistry. See you there!  Present Science, Network, Mingle, Celebrate
