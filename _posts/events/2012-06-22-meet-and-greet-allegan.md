Report by Lydia Hines
---

A good chemist is an experimentalist. And that is exactly how Elke
Schoffers, our current chair, with the concurrence of the Executive
Committee and partial support from a grant from the National Office
proceeded in setting up an informal gathering open to all members; for
**the first time that any of the Executive Committee can recall** our
Local Section held such a gathering in Allegan County, another of our
counties in the Kalamazoo Local Section. Perrigo Company was a willing
co-sponsor for the event.

It was a sunny afternoon when approximately 13 members and a family
gathered at Dailey’s Kitchen for pizza, lasagna, cookies, veggies,
cheese and crackers, a report on the Section’s past, current, and
future activities and good conversation. Informational and educational
materials were available for distribution, and as promised a crossword
puzzle was distributed; after light- hearted competition Mark Wolf
(Kalsec) won the promised prize. It was a pleasant opportunity to
encourage members whom we do not often see at regular meetings in
Kalamazoo and to give them opportunity to join with us in our outreach
activities through the year.

An experiment that was well worth trying to test the “hypothesis” that
having a meeting at a location other that Kalamazoo would show the
Section’s interest in “retaining” all our Section members.

Do you know which element circulates in rumors of having been despised
by Mahatma Gandhi?  Mark Wolf did! He won the puzzle prize at the KACS
Meet 'N Greet in Allegan on June 22, 2012. Congratulations!
