   National Chemistry Week will be upon us before we know it; the
   week itself is October 19-25 but <strong>our annual outreach
   event</strong> at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum will be
   on <strong>Saturday 11 October</strong> from noon to 4 p.m. This
   year's theme is <em>The Sweet Side of Chemistry &ndash;
   Candy</em> and our hard-working collaborator at the Museum,
   Annette Hoppenworth, is looking forward to our participation and
   successful execution of this immensely popular program once
   again. Parents, grandparents, teachers, scout leaders and
   children are always rewarded with fun hands-on activities, and
   with written materials which they may take to their homes and
   their schools for encouragement in their science learning â€“ we
   have all heard of STEM education; this informal science learning
   experience is a big part of it at an age when children
   are <strong>scientists in the making</strong> &ndash;
   inquisitive and truly curious. To volunteer for the event please
   contact <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia E. M. Hines</a>. If
   you are at a loss for an activity, she has a list she can send
   you, and she can train you in an activity of your choice.
