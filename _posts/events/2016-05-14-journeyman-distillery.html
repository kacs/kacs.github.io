    Our Science Caf&eacute; Field Trip to Journeyman Distilling in Three
    Oaks, MI took place on May 14, and was attended by fourteen members
    and guests of the KACS and nine members of the St. Joseph Valley
    Local Section. We started with a discussion of the history of the
    facility, which started out as a featherbone corset and buggy whip
    factory, and then stood empty for decades before a major restoration
    effort turned it into a distillery. We then toured their production
    space, which currently includes a 1000 gallon still which they run
    for two twelve hour runs each day to collect about 25 gallons of
    spirit a day! We had a great discussion about the heads, hearts,
    and tails of the distillation run, and many of us were both amazed
    and disappointed to find out that all of their analytical chemistry
    in analyzing their cuts is done by taste! We ended our visit by
    tasting many of their fourteen bottled spirits, learning a little
    about proper tasting along the way.
