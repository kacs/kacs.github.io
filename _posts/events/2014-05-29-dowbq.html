  On May 29th, 2014, the Kalamazoo College Chemistry Club held their
  annual DowBQ, where students and faculty socialize while eating some
  great food and playing yard games. The DowBQ gets its name from the
  fact that both Chemistry and Biology majors are housed in the Dow
  Science Building. All chemistry and biology students, as well as
  faculty, were invited to the barbecue; it is a great time for
  underclassmen to ask seniors and faculty for advice on internships,
  completing the Senior Individualized Project (SIP), and applying to
  medical school or graduate school. Over 70 students attended the
  event and took the time to celebrate being part of the scientific
  community at Kalamazoo College.
