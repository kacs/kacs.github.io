<h1 id="awards-gathering">46<sup>th</sup> Annual Awards Gathering KACS
  Celebration 2019</h1>

<p>
  May 5, 2019 was a pleasant day in Kalamazoo in many ways, one of
  which was the annual gathering of KACS members along with students
  and parents/friends in the chemistry building at Western Michigan
  University (WMU) for the presentation of awards to long-time ACS
  members, deserving students and teachers as well as to other KACS
  members in our local section area (Kalamazoo, Allegan and Van Buren
  counties). It was an amiable group of approximately 80 gathered for
  the hors d’oeuvres in the lobby graced by a large Periodic table
  whose internationally- recognized 150 th anniversary is this
  year. Awards were presented immediately after this light supper to
  one graduating senior from WMU and one from Kalamazoo College, each
  nominated as outstanding by the respective school’s chemistry
  department faculty, and to Mr. Jon Taylor, chemistry teacher from
  Portage Central High School who, according to his students, is “the
  best teacher they have had in their lives”.  To receive his 50-year
  membership certificate from the American Chemical Society was
  Dr. Wade Adams, and to receive the Volunteer service award from the
  ACS Committee on Community Activities was Dr. Thomas A. Runge who
  spear-headed the writing of the successful application for the
  National Historical Chemical Landmark presented in 2019 to our
  community in recognition of the 1950-1990 Kalamazoo Steroid
  Chemistry Work done at The Upjohn Company. Following those
  recognitions came the presentation of certificates and prizes to 6
  outstanding chemistry students nominated by their HS teachers, as
  well as to 20 students with exemplary scores on a 2-tiered
  examination given by our section’s Education Committee. All present
  seemed to be very appreciative of the examination program and the
  recognition it offers; it was conceived and implemented by
  Dr. Adams, our 50-year member, when he was chair of our Section in
  1982! The following pictures of the three groups of students show
  the pleasure experienced by all those present&hellip;
