Report on our Kalamazoo Section’s National Chemistry Week (NCW) 2012
===
“Nanotechnology: the smallest BIG idea in science”
---

The Kalamazoo Section celebrated the theme with

- A **poster contest** for all children in grades K-12 in our Local Section; two teachers participated in 2 grade categories (6-8, 9-12) with posters submitted for National judging (see below) – **our entry for Gr. 9-12** (by Cassie Kiewiet at Heritage Christian Academy) was selected as a **National winning entry**; she received a certificate and a cheque for $300 from the National ACS (to see **all winning entries** search the internet for “NCW Illustrated Poster Contest).
- A **[live TV interview](http://archive.org/details/MNLCelebratingChemistry10-01-12.mpg)** with two of our members on 2012-10-01 - highlighting the topic and informing the public of the free hands-on Chemistry activity at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum; it was broadcast at least 5 times during the following 2 weeks to a coverage area of 300,000 residents.
- Our flagship event for NCW was our **hands-on science event** at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum: **Fliers** of advertisement were distributed throughout the area, the event was publicized in our **online Section newsletter** and on our **Section website**, via **e-mail** to all K-12 schools, 1000 **lacemats** (see copy below) were delivered and used at restaurants in corridor areas and **announcements and advertisements** were published in the *Three Rivers Commercial-News*, the *Kalamazoo Gazette*, *Excelsior*, and a Kalamazoo Valley Museum quarterly **magazine**, *Museon*. Local libraries distributed 400 copies of the *Celebrating Chemistry* publication along with fliers to their young patrons.

This, our 26th hands-on activity (we had 2 in 1988) was attended by
727 patrons during four hours on a rainy, cold Saturday afternoon;
fifty-nine (59) volunteers were on hand to present 23 activities from
nano-gold, to elephant toothpaste, to slime, to nano-sand, to the
volcano; these tables were staffed by high school students, college
students, graduate and undergraduate students, faculty, industrial
chemists, retirees, and community members. It seemed like all three
floors of the museum were a-buzz with joyful learners of all ages. One
incentive was the promise of a **“prize”** to visitors who completed
at least 10 activities – the youngsters loved that, and at least 150
availed themselves of the opportunity and claimed a **nano mole** as
their prize.

Over the 25 years that our Section has co-hosted this event with the
Kalamazoo Valley Museum many patrons have become loyal participants,
returning to get ideas for their own use in their classrooms, their
homes, their scout troops, etc. Some who came as children themselves
are now bringing their own children to introduce them to activities
that meant so much to them! [Look for a testimonial in the Comment by
Cheryl Frech, chair of the ACS Committee on Public Relations and
Communications, in the December 10, 2012, issue of *C&amp;EN*]. **Just this
year a lawyer who brought his son to the event took copies of our
ACS-provided handouts and reported later that he spent considerable
time doing activities at home with his son!**

Many educational materials, from both the current and prior years,
were distributed. Though the survey software was not functional
through the whole afternoon there was delight registered in everyone’s
face during the event, and on the way out participants left with
questions about the timing of our **next** activity! [The planned theme
for NCW 2013 is “Energy: Now and Forever”]

Four members of the Chemistry Graduate Student Association from
Western Michigan University assisted with refurbishing efforts at a
historic home in the West Kalamazoo area as a community outreach to
highlight the concept of “Making More with Less”

A reminder to our members that the mission of NCW is to reach the
public, particularly elementary and secondary school students, with
positive messages about chemistry; its major thrust is the improvement
of the public’s impression of the role chemistry and chemists play in
every aspect of our way of life and its quality – in the matters of
health, materials, energy, technology, and the environment.
