      Though wintry temperatures came rolling in to Kalamazoo, MI, on
      Saturday, October 13, 2018, <strong>60 volunteers</strong>* (15 of
      them KACS members) - many for 4 hours and others in 2-hour shifts â€“
      gathered at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum (KVM) from noon to 4 pm to
      present <strong>20 activities</strong> on two floors and the large
      theater to <strong>600 patrons</strong>.  Visitors included extended
      families, scout leaders, practicing teachers, with many repeat
      visitors and several who had come as children themselves to one or
      more of our previous 31 events.  An <strong>additional
	attraction</strong> during the four-hour afternoon offerings this
      year was the inclusion by our generous host, the KVM, of <strong>3
	free planetarium</strong> shows at regular intervals.  Volunteers,
      who were solicited widely from area companies, colleges/university,
      high schools and other area science-teaching centers, were informed
      of our <strong>emphasis on safety</strong> both in terms of our own
      participation and our interactions with the attendees as they did
      the activities.  Many education-related materials from ACS and other
      sources were gladly received by our visitors who expressed
      <strong>enthusiasm</strong> about the variety of available stations
      through the afternoon, as well as about learning of the availability
      of ACS' large assortment of age-appropriate resoures; there seemed
      to be greater-than-average interest expressed in subsequent use of
      these resources to continue science learning after the program.

      * Volunteers were employees from Pfizer, Perrigo and Kalsec; WMU -
      faculty, retired staff and students; faculty and students from KVCC;
      and K College students; some HS chem students (Loy Norrix, Mattawan,
      Portage Northern) and others from the community (e.g., Air Zoo, KVM
      volunteers). An <strong>e-mail of appreciation</strong> was sent to
      the Museum leadership, and to each volunteer whose e-address was
      available.

<h2>More Hands-On Offerings</h2>
<h3>25 October 2018</h3>
<p>
  Among the large number of offerings presented to children and their
  families at the Lake Center Elementary (Portage)
  STEAM night <strong>for the third successive year</strong>,
  favorites were hands-on activities by our KACS Western Michigan
  University Chem club students and several of our members.  There was
  an attendance of ~600 engaged children during the 3-hour event.
</p>

<h2>Materials Distribution to Other Local Section Venues</h2>

<p>
  Copies of Celebrating Chemistry were distributed to organizations in
  our Local Section area which provide science outreach to our
  communities: copies in Spanish were donated to our <strong>Kalamazoo
  Public Library</strong> for their Hispanic Heritage Month
  celebration; copies in both English and Spanish were given to the
  <strong>Air Zoo</strong> (which also was a host site for one of our
  <emph>Voyage to Mars</emph> Program-In-A-Box presentations) for use
  in their many student programs through the year; and were
  distributed to patrons at a very successful STEAM night hands-on
  Science event at <strong>Lake Center Elementary</strong> in Portage,
  MI, on October 25, 2018, where some of our members also engaged the
  children and families in hands-on activities.

    <strong>We still need a lot of helping hands from our members for
      this much anticipated event!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We would love to hear that you are interested in volunteering; if
    you are not sure what you might want to present we have a list of
    activity suggestions from prior years, or you may want to work
    alongside someone else as a "helper" at a table. Please join the
    few who have responded to date and contact our NCW
    coordinator <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia Hines</a> -
    advanced planning makes the event more pleasurable.
