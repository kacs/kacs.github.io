<p>
  Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum is right around the
  corner! As in the past this well attended annual event (~ 1000
  children and adults) is held in conjunction
  with <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/ncw.html"
  alt="National chemistry week website">National Chemistry Week</a>
  (NCW). The 2018 theme is <em>Chemistry is out of this
  world</em>. The Fall 2018 Kalamazoo Valley Museum
  publication, <em>museON</em>, page 14, had
  an <a href="https://www.kalamazoomuseum.org/info/museON/museographies/MuseON_Fall%202018_.pdf"
  title="MuseON article">enthusiastic article</a> about the impact
  which KACS members have had on our community over many years, with
  positive mention of this outreach event which has continued for the
  past 31 years.

    <strong>We still need a lot of helping hands from our members for
      this much anticipated event!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We would love to hear that you are interested in volunteering; if
    you are not sure what you might want to present we have a list of
    activity suggestions from prior years, or you may want to work
    alongside someone else as a "helper" at a table. Please join the
    few who have responded to date and contact our NCW
    coordinator <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia Hines</a> -
    advanced planning makes the event more pleasurable.
