    Though it was a beautiful Fall afternoon with many competing events
    in the Kalamazoo, MI, area, for four hours beginning at noon on
    October 8 at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum we saw a large number of
    enthusiastic visitors of all ages; they were treated to a
    smorgasbord of 23 hands-on activities which included 6 in an area
    that required a solution to a "mystery" heist. This was all the
    result of the hard work and enthusiasm shown by about 60 volunteers,
    approximately half of whom were high school and college/university
    students :) Their availability to work with our public and to show
    them how much they love chemistry was exemplary! The smiles on the
    children's faces, and their accompanying adults' expressed thanks,
    were the icing on the cake for the afternoon. The museum staff are
    still talking about it. The level of engagement and family
    interaction surpassed all past programs - it was noteworthy that
    parents were not on their phones but actually working and talking
    with their children. We heard several patrons ask what colleges to
    go to so that they could become a chemist. Most of our visitors were
    here for at least two hours during the 4-hour program. According to
    the latest count we reached somewhere around 700, with over 500
    people doing the CSI mystery.

      In summary, the 30th anniversary event was a <strong>tremendous
	success because of our volunteers'</strong> willingness to share time,
      talent and enthusiasm, and we applaud them. Maybe YOU can plan to
      join us in 2017 when our theme will be <em>Geochemistry -
	Chemistry Rocks</em>
