A 1992 Honda Civic compact Car was converted from the standard
internal combustion gasoline power to 100% electric power. The energy
for propulsion is now stored in rechargeable batteries carried on
board. This talk will address the motivation for this project, its
design, its implementation, and the results.  Can electrification be
readily applied to other forms of transportation? Join us for the
discussion.

This event is open to ACS members, non-members and the general
public. Please RSVP to
