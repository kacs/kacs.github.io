In support of the Community Event associated with this yearâ€™s National
Chemistry Week, the Chemistry Graduate Student Association (CGSA) at
Western Michigan University pursued a project with Oshtemo
Township. Four CGSA members spent two and a half hours at Drake House
(927 Drake Road, Oshtemo Township) on Friday, October 26; we assisted
the Oshtemo Historical Society in insulating the second floor windows
and sanding several wooden support beams on the front porch.

The President of the Oshtemo Historical Society was most appreciative
of our efforts and time invested, and, in turn, we were pleased to
have been able to contribute to a local, historic public works
project.

Drake House was originally built in 1852 by Benjamin Drake, one of the
first settlers in the Kalamazoo area.  The house remained as private
property until 2004, when it was acquired by Oshtemo Township. Since
that time, the Oshtemo Historical Society has been working with
Oshtemo Township to restore the house.
