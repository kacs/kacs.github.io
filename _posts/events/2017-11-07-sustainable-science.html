    <h3>It Was Preventable and Can Happen to You!</h3>

    <p class="author">
      By Monique Wilhelm, University of Michigan-Flint Laboratory Manager
      and Chemical Hygiene Officer

    <p>
      Everyone has heard about the health effects that resulted from the
      change of the source of water for the city of Flint. The national
      media has chosen to focus on the health issues and on whom to
      blame. But do you really know what made Flint's water unsafe?
      Without going into the politics of the decision or trying to
      identify blame, the audience will participate in a hands on activity
      to learn more about what happened with the water from an elementary
      chemistry viewpoint. The presenter will also discuss some of the
      side effects this community is experiencing that aren't being
      addressed in the media from the viewpoint of someone living through
      this crisis.
