      Everyone has heard about the health effects that resulted from the
      change of the source of water for the city of Flint. The national
      media has chosen to focus on the health issues and on whom to
      blame. But do you really know what made Flint's water unsafe?
      Without going into the politics of the decision or trying to
      identify blame, the audience will participate in a hands on activity
      to learn more about what happened with the water from an elementary
      chemistry viewpoint. The presenter will also discuss some of the
      side effects this community is experiencing that aren't being
      addressed in the media from the viewpoint of someone living through
      this crisis.

    On Nov. 7, 2017 KACS hosted its annual poster session titled
    "Sustainable Science - Recycle a Poster" at Bell's Eccentric
    Café in downtown Kalamazoo. For the 7th year in a row, KACS
    organized this public event, which was made possible through a
    generous grant from Zoetis. There was a record turnout of 153
    people. This keynote speaker was Monique Wilhelm from the
    University of Michigan-Flint. In her roles as Laboratory Manager
    and Adjunct Lecturer, she witnessed the water crisis first hand
    when it first unfolded in 2014. Her presentation “The Real
    Crisis with Flint’s Water - It Was Preventable and Can Happen to
    You!” included a demo with hands-on activities for the
    audience. It involved three pennies, a salt pack, vinegar and
    plastic containers to learn about the influence of the water’s
    pH on metal. In addition to the keynote speech, there was a
    poster session with over 30 presentations, including 21 student
    presenters.  At least 50% of those in attendance were ACS
    members. Participants enjoyed hot appetizers and beer from 5 to
    9 pm while listening to the keynote speech, mingling and
    reviewing the displays. Posters highlighted work from Zoetis,
    Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University (WMU), among
    others. Some work was done in collaboration with other
    institutions.

    Students who submitted a poster abstract for this event ahead of
    time had the opportunity to win a $50 cash prize, which was handed
    out by KACS Treasurer Bill Schinzer. The lucky winners were Daniel
    Corey, Jashaun Bottoms and Gabriel Aleida
    Alves. The <span class="winner">prizewinners</span> presented the
    following posters.

    This year’s event also included the celebration of the “Partners
    for Progress and Prosperity (P3) Award” that was given to the
    Kalamazoo ACS Local Section, Zoetis, and Bell’s Eccentric
    Caf&eacute; for offering this annual poster event in a 3-way
    collaboration. The award was given for incorporating 3 important
    categories, specifically for 1) organizing a public event to help
    improve the public image and perception of science in general and
    of chemistry in particular; 2) helping improve career development
    through networking opportunities in an informal setting; and 3)
    supporting the importance of STEM education and research via its
    keynote speaker and poster session.
  </p>
  <p>
    KACS Chair Dr. Steve Secreast also showed a brief video he filmed
    at the Kalamazoo pedestrian mall that showed public volunteers
    reciting the elements of the periodic table. Last but not least,
    the KACS Board is grateful for the financial support that Zoetis
    has provided to help defer the expenses associated with this
    event.
