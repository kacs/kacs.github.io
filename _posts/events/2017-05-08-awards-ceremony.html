  Monday, May 8, offered inviting weather for our 44th celebration of
  our Section's Award Ceremony. Approximately 95 students, parents and
  friends gathered in the atrium of the Chemistry Building at WMU to
  celebrate the accomplishments of High School students and a teacher,
  College students, as well as to recognize service to the American
  Chemical Society and to the local section. Our Examination
  subcommittee chair, Dr. <b>James Kiddle</b>, was his typical
  efficient self in administering the requisite examinations and in
  making all the necessary arrangements for this gathering - the
  d&eacute;cor and food were much appreciated.
</p>

<p>
  Our section chairman, <b>Steve Secreast</b>, introduced our two College
  awardees (one from Kalamazoo College and one from Western Michigan
  University) followed by our Outstanding Chemistry Students as
  nominated by each student's teacher (each of the 9 present received an
  Amazon Gift card and a certificate) and ended by naming and giving
  awards to the 21 winners of our competitive scholarship examination -
  we had a tie for first and fourth places and a 4-way tie for seventh
  place! The students were happy to let us know their future plans, most
  of which involved STEM study.
</p>

<p>
  The teacher recognized was Ms. <b>Michelle Mason</b> from Portage
  Northern HS. The <b>Section award for service</b> went to Mark
  Wolfman who has continued as our section webmaster despite his move
  to Chicago for graduate school; <b>Brian Eklov</b> received a Salute to
  Excellence plaque; and <b>Doug Williams</b> received the 2016 Volunteer
  award from the Committee on Community Activities for his major role
  in our 30th annual Museum Event.
</p>

<p>
  It was very heartening also to recognize <b>3 60-year members of ACS
    - D. C. Wendt, Ray Judy, and Chuck C. Coverdale</b> - and <b>6
    50-year members - John Engelmann, John Greenfield, Mike
    McCarville, Alan Sarapu, Lydia Hines, and Doug Morton</b> (in
    absentia); each of them received a certificate of appreciation
    from ACS for service to the Society.
</p>

<p>
  This year's event was a wonderful reminder that the future of our
  science is in "good hands" and each attendee seemed to enjoy the
  opportunity to meet friends who come each year and to make new
  acquaintances.
