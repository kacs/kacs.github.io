      The KACS hosted Career consultant Dr. Lisa Balbes on the campus
      of Kalamazoo College for a talk on <em>Careers in
      Chemistry</em>, on October 4, 2018.  Having received a grant
      from the LSAC (Local Section Activities Committee) for
      "co-hosting a meeting with a neighboring local section", this
      was a meeting co-hosted with the Huron Valley Section; several
      other local sections in MI, IN, IL were also invited to
      participate virtually using the ZOOM platform.  Though the
      number of attendees in any of the locations was small,
      Dr. Balbes presented a very informative overview of the
      opportunities available to those who choose to pursue a degree
      in chemistry and show initiative in assessing their personal
      strengths while also seeking to evaluate new avenues of personal
      growth.  Many career resources were shared that evening. For ACS
      members, the
      <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-navigator.html">
	Career Navigator</a> is an amazing resource.
