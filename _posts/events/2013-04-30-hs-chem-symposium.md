It was a wet morning when sixty High School students from 6 high
schools in a 9-county area along with their teachers arrived at the
Chemistry Building on the WMU campus for the fortieth KACS-sponsored
High School Science Symposium. No morning event would be complete
without donuts and Kool-Aid. The local section is always indebted to
Western Michaigan University for hosting the event and to members and
friends who take the time to hold interactive sessions with the
students or give tours of their facilities.

This year’s keynote address was given by Bridget Lorenz Lemberg of
Forensic Fluids who gave a talk entitled “Oral Fluid Drug Testing: The
Story of Forensic Fluids”. The other presenters and their topics were
Manuel Bautista, “Our Place in the Universe”; Frank Meints &
M. Morris, “Glass Blowing” Demonstration; Sherine Obare,
“Nanochemistry” Demonstration; Stephanie Morley, “Veterinary
Medicine”; Torrey Wenger, “Tales of a Field Biologist”; Asghar Kayani,
“Linear Accelerator”; Mark Wolf, “Food Chemistry – the Spices of
Life”; Kathryn Docherty, “Microbial Biodiversity”; and Robert
Eversole, “Electron Microscope” Demonstration.

Sincere appreciation is extended to the Education Committee - Donald
Schreiber , James Kiddle, Sherine Obare, and Andre Venter - for
organizing and publicizing the Symposium, and to Robin Lenkart for her
able organizational assistance once again.
