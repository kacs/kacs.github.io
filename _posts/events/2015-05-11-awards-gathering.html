  <p>
    The Kalamazoo section of the American Chemical Society held its
    <b>forty-second</b> annual awards program on Monday, May 11, 2015 at
    Western Michigan University.  Awardees gathered along with family
    members, educators, and KACS members at 6 pm for a reception in the
    Chemistry Building Atrium with light hors d’oeuvres.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ceremony followed at 6:45pm when KACS Chair Brian Eklov formally
    assembled all in attendance in the large lecture hall. Award
    presentations began with ACS 50+ members. First up
    was <strong>50-year member Dr. Malcolm W. Moon</strong> who shared
    with the audience his career and love of organic chemistry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not to be outdone, <strong>Dr. Thomas Houser</strong> received an
    award as a 60-year member. He explained how he was transformed from
    factory worker to physical chemist to educator while injecting a
    couple of "propellant experiments gone awry" anecdotes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next up, Western Michigan University Chemistry Department honored
    <strong>Nicholas Kapolka as their outstanding college chemistry
      student</strong> while <strong>Thanh Thanh Phan</strong> was honored
    with the same distinction from the Kalamazoo College Department of
    Chemistry.
