  It will be our 31<sup>st</sup> year of offering this popular
  outreach event, and we look forward to having YOU <b>join us as a
    presenter of a hands-on activity</b> for the ~1000 attendees. The
  theme for this year's celebration is <b><i>Chemistry Rocks</i></b>
  with a particular focus on gemstones, rocks and minerals, but our
  activities need not be limited by that designation.
</p>
<p>
  This event is our highly-anticipated and well-received hands-on
  program for the Southwest Michigan community and it is held annually
  at the <a href="http://kvm.kvcc.edu/plan/maps.htm">Kalamazoo Valley
    Museum</a> with the able help of Annette Hoppenworth. To present the
  large number of activities (usually ~30) we depend primarily on
  <b>YOU, our members to volunteer as leaders at each of the tables</b>
  so that young people, and those who bring them, will get a taste of
  <b>the excitement of chemistry in everyday life</b>. Consider this
  as your contribution to our patrons' STEM education.
</p>
<p>
  If you are willing to give time on <b>October 14</b> we have ideas
  of hands-on activities from which you may select, or you may lead an
  activity of your own choosing; all you need to do is to identify
  yourself to our NCW coordinator, <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia
    Hines</a>, and let her know your availability to help, or let her
  know what activity you would like to lead. Many thanks.
