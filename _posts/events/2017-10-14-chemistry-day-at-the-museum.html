  Unlike other years' beautiful October weather on our Chemistry Days,
  this year the 14<sup>th</sup> of October was an unusually rainy and
  cool day in Kalamazoo. An enthusiastic group of 60+ volunteers - 15
  ACS members, 5 ACS student members and 40 students or other
  colleagues from 2 high schools and 3 local colleges and several
  industries, etc. - gathered to present 25 separate hands-on
  activities and demonstrations and to hand out resources to over 1000
  attendees at our much-anticipated 31<sup>st</sup> 4-hour event at
  the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, the venue which has graciously been our
  host for this event for the past 30 years. Publicity had been sent
  to K-12 teachers and to other public venues by e-mail and social
  media, and through the medium of TV to the broader community in SW
  Michigan, and even to the northern Indiana border by friends of
  friends who learned of it through the museum's and our
  announcements! Given the theme of this year's event, <em>Chemistry
  Rocks!</em> colleagues from the Kalamazoo Geological and Mineral
  Society joined us, and they presented some of their displays and
  talked to the patrons regarding how chemistry and geology are
  intertwined.

<h2>National Chemistry Week Event</h2>

<p>
  Hi KACS!
</p>
<p>
  We had a wonderful night​ at our second Lake Center Elementary
  "I&lt;3 STEM" night​ on November 30, 2017. We estimate that there
  were over 800 people and I'm not counting the number of students in
  attendance. There ​seems to have been a balanced distribution of
  attendance across the 5 - 11 year old range. It's rumored that some
  of the public heard and came to check it out too. ​ This is an event
  we hope to do again.... as it went SUPER well <em>Big Shout
  outs</em> to ​the ​Kalamazoo ​Section of the American ​Chemi​cal Society
  for ​​providing ​booklets and ​funding for our event. ​With your support
  we were able to purchase needed materials​, and ​the ​Celebrating
  Chemistry ​booklets were given out in handle bags, ​along with trading
  cards that featured STEM professionals. ​The WMU ChemClub table
  (picture included below) ​helped the children make slime and ​change
  copper pennies to "silver or gold" ​pennies.
</p>
<p>
  On behalf of the Lake Center PTO​, the students, staff and families,
  thank-you!
</p>
<p>
  Sincerely,<br />
  Stephanie Norg<br />
