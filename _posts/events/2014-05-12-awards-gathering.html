The Local Section leadership would like to invite you to join us for
our annual Awards Gathering, a relaxed event at which we honor
outstanding high-school and college students, high-school teachers,
50-year members of the ACS, past chairs of our Section, and also
recognize individuals in our Section who have contributed their time
selflessly over a period of time. <strong>The Awards Committee is
soliciting nominations for the Section Award from you</strong>, the
members.  To suggest someone for consideration for the Section Award
please send the nominee's name, along with a short summary of that
person's service to the Section, to the Committee chair, Lydia Hines
(269-375-7349 or
<a href="mailto:lemhwgh@gmail.com?subject=awards nominee"
   title="E-mail Lydia">lemhwgh@gmail.com</a>) by May 3.

  After the event, all award recipients will be posted here. For a
