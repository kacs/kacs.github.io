    <h2>Sense-ational Molecules in Nutrition</h2>
    <p>
      As part of its &ldquo;Chemistry & Culture&rdquo; series, KACS hosted
      a free, public event that focused on food
      titled <strong>&ldquo;Sense-ational Molecules in
	Nutrition&rdquo;</strong> at Bell&#39;s Eccentric Caf&eacute; on January
      29, 2014, 6-10 PM. It attracted 98 people who were curious to see a
      presentation, enjoy demonstrations and a variety of snacks. Dr. Sara
      Risch of <em>Popz Europe</em> gave the keynote speech connecting
      nutrition and science by commenting on fats and sodium in foods,
      among others.  She also used jelly beans in order for the audience
      to experience the difference between <em>taste</em>
      and <em>flavor</em>. The talk was followed by
      hands-on-activities. Several different tables were set up for
      everybody to visit with and learn more about chemesthesis, natural
      colors, beer foaming action, and emulsions.

<h2>Why Chemistry & Culture?</h2>
<p>
  Chemists are not just experts in their field but are also interested
  in art, history, cooking, baking, brewing, gardening and exercise,
  among others. &ldquo;Elements of Dance&rdquo; invited all chemists, chemistry
  enthusiasts and the general public to enjoy ballroom dancing. Future
  &ldquo;Chemistry and Culture&rdquo; themes will address topics like &ldquo;Art
  Conservation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Forgery&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cooking&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gardening&rdquo;, for example.
</p>
<p>
  The goals of the &ldquo;Chemistry and Culture&rdquo; series are...
  <ul>
    <li>
      To offer a social networking opportunity for members of the
      Kalamazoo Local Section of the American Chemical Society (KACS)
      and the public
    </li>
    <li>
      To educate the general public about the goals and activities of
      KACS
    </li>
    <li>
      To highlight the connections between &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;culture&rdquo;
    </li>
    <li>
      To encourage student participation
    </li>
    <li>
      To instill an appreciation for how chemistry contributes to the
      world in many ways
    </li>
    <li>
      To forge ties with the local community
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
