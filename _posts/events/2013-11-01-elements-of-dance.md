Why Chemistry and Culture?
---
Chemists are not just experts in their field but are also interested
in art, history, cooking, baking, brewing, gardening and exercise,
among others. **“Elements of Dance”** invites all chemists, chemistry
enthusiasts and the general public to enjoy ballroom dancing. Future
“Chemistry and Culture” themes will address topics like “Art
Conservation”, “Forgery”, “Cooking” and “Gardening”, for example.

The goals of the "Chemistry and Culture" series are...

- To offer a social networking opportunity for members of the Kalamazoo Local Section of the American Chemical Society (KACS) and the public
- To educate the general public about the goals and activities of KACS
- To highlight the connections between "chemistry" and "culture"
- To encourage student participation
- To instill an appreciation for how chemistry contributes to the world in many ways
- To forge ties with the local community
