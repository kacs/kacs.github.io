      This lecture will address image techniques, from synthesizing
      pigments to the development of optics. Imagery innovation has
      changed our view of art and has gradually made possible the
      pictorial mania of today.
    </p>
    <p>
      We live in an age of visual abundance where the tools of art
      production and distribution are remarkably accessible. Access to
      these tools has changed the way we look at images and our
      expectations for art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art innovation, however, is not unique to our time. Material and
      technical innovations are as old as art itself and they have
      consistently changed the way images are produced, the nature of
      those images, and the art experience.
