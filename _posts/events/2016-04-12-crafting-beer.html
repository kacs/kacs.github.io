    On April 12, KACS's topical group <em>The Kalamazoo Area Mass
      Sepectrometry Discussion Group</em> and Thermo Fisher Scientific
    hosted a seminar on mass spectrometry and the science behind
    crafting beer. This event at Bells Brewery Eccentric Caf√© brought
    91 attendees together. The crowd represented a wholesome mix of
    those working in mass spectrometry or in the brewing industry and
    included professionals, students and other interested members of
    the public.  Two presentations were presented providing a mixed
    taste of beer quality control and beer flavor innovation.

    The first presentation was delivered by Dr. Barbara Dunn from the
    Department of Genetics at Stanford University and was
    entitled <em>The Systematic Integration of Omics Data to Improve
      Innovation in Beer Crafting</em>. Dr. Dunn described how systems
    biology is used to study, for example, the differences between
    popular yeast strains used in the production of California Ale and
    Hefeweizen beer styles.

    Dr. Luke Chadwick, Senior Scientist at Bells Brewery, presented on
    how the challenge to make a delicious beer consistently can be
    addressed by picking it apart at the molecular level. Dr. Chadwick
    presented an overview of the instrumentation used in a brewing
    laboratory and on the role of data in the quest for ever-increasing
    beer quality. He dazzled us with numerous rabbit holes of yet to be
    explored challenges faced by those who take a scientific approach to
    crafting quality beer.

    Thermo Fisher Scientific demonstrated the use of the
    Gallery<sup>&trade;</sup> Plus Beermaster. This photometric analyzer
    provides automated efficiency in quality control measurements to
    help reduce costs and improve productivity in breweries. For more
