  <h2>Who Pays for Safety Failures in the Chemistry Laboratory?</h2>
  <p>
   Thanks to those who attended the KACS Local Section Meeting on the
   ever-current topic of safety at 6:00 p.m. on
   <strong>Tuesday 23 September</strong> 2014 in the <strong>Dow
	Science Building Lecture Hall at Kalamazoo College</strong>
   We had <strong>Dr. Kenneth Fivizzani</strong>, Nalco
   Company (retired) and Chair, ACS Division of Chemical Health &amp;
   Safety as our speaker.

  <p>
   The chemistry community and the general public have become more
   aware of incidents in chemical laboratories. Some serious
   accidents in both academic and industrial laboratories have had
   widespread repercussions to the organizations in which these
   accidents occur. If a regulatory agency, such as OSHA or EPA,
   cites a violation of a law or regulation, fines and remediation
   costs can be significant. Legal expenses for responses, trials,
   and appeals can grow quickly. But there are broader costs to the
   reputations of principal investigators, departments,
   institutions, and even for the science of chemistry. If students
   do not feel safe in undergraduate and research laboratories,
   they will be less likely to choose a career in science. If the
   general public does not trust chemical professionals to work
   safely in laboratories, there could be calls for more regulation
   of lab activity, and funding for chemical research might be
   reduced. There are many good reasons for organizations to
   establish strong safety cultures and ensure that laboratory
   personnel are well trained in lab safety procedures and
   policies.

<p>There will be time at the end for questions.</p>
<p>
  Dr. Fivizzani met with <strong>graduate and undergraduate
    students</strong> before his lecture for a <strong>roundtable
    discussion</strong> concerning the large variety of
    non-traditional careers available to students who earn degrees in
    chemistry. For additional career-related
    information see the <em>careers</em> page in the first monthly
