As a community service, we will collect spent batteries for
responsible disposal.

Learn about **Energy Conservation** and the **KVCC Wind Turbine** as
part of this year’s energy theme, in addition to annual favorites like
**Slime** and **Iron in Cereal**. There will be over 25 different
activities:

<h2>Another Successful Chemistry Day at the Museum</h2>
<h3>What a whirl of activity this year, whose chosen theme was “Energy – Now and Forever”</h3>
<p class="author">By Lydia Bines</p>

<p>
  Students in grades K-12 were invited to submit illustrated poems on
  the theme. Response was received from 2 schools with entries in
  Grades 3-5 and 9-12. These will be submitted to the National
  competition and we await to hear how our entries may fare – maybe we
  can get another national winner, as we did last year.
</p>
<p>
  Celebrating Chemistry, a publication prepared by the ACS for
  youngsters in grades 4-6, was distributed to the Kalamazoo and
  Portage Libraries, the Museum publicized Chemistry Day at the
  Kalamazoo Valley Museum in their quarterly magazine <em>Museon</em>
  and in the <em>Kalamazoo Gazette</em> and flyers were distributed to
  all K-12 teachers for whom we have
  e-addresses.  <em>ChemMatters</em>, a publication prepared by ACS
  for High School students, was distributed to those who came to the
  Museum event.
</p>
<p>
  With the expert, tireless and valuable assistance of Annette
  Hoppenworth 87 volunteers (KACS members and friends) participated in
  our largest outreach effort of the week; we presented 29 hands-on
  activities to about 700 patrons on a beautiful Fall Saturday in our
  southwest corner of Michigan.  It was heartening to welcome 35
  first-time volunteers!  Teachers, parents, scout leaders and
  children left with smiles on their faces, bags full of materials to
  encourage their continued learning at home and/or in the classroom,
  and with a good taste of the excitement of chemistry and science in
  general, as a result of having been encouraged to observe and
  participate in our activities.  A very warm thank you goes to all
  who made this event another successful one for our Section.
