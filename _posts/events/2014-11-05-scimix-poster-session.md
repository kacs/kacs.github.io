<h2>Present Science, Network, Mingle, Celebrate Kalamazoo Chemistry</h2>

**Student poster presenters won prize!**

**Undergraduate and graduate students were encouraged to participate.**

The Kalamazoo area has always been historically rich with exciting
chemistry. Thanks to everyone who joined us and shared the area’s
wealth of exciting chemistry by bringing posters of their chemistry
accomplishments. The posters were either be newly prepared or a
recycled poster from a previous event. This Mixer invited local
academic and industrial chemists from all areas of chemistry:
Analytical, Biochemistry, Inorganic, Organic, and Physical, in
addition to Food and Medicinal Chemistry. Present Science, Network,
Mingle, Celebrate Kalamazoo Chemistry

  This year KACS hosted Professor Timothy F. Jamison (MIT) during its
  annual poster session. He presented a keynote speech on continuous
  flow chemistry.

Continuous Flow Multistep Synthesis
---
#### by Keynote Speaker Prof. Tim Jamison (6 pm)
**Abstract:** Flow chemistry has the potential to revolutionize the
synthesis of organic molecules. Flow systems can reduce reaction
times, increase efficiency, and obviate problems often encountered in
scaling up. In addition to these important practical advantages, flow
chemistry expands the “toolbox” of organic reactions available to
scientists engaged in the synthesis of molecules – from small-scale
experiments to large-scale production. These benefits are a direct
result of several features of flow synthesis that batch synthesis
typically cannot achieve, for example, the ability to control fluid
flow precisely, the access to temperature and pressure regimes not
usually considered to be practical, and the enhanced safety
characteristics of flow chemical systems. In this lecture we will
discuss some of our investigations in this area in the form of case
studies, wherein a specific target or family of organic molecules has
served as an inspiration for the development of new methods of organic
synthesis in flow.

<h2>Event Report</h2>

<p>
  Now in its fourth year, KACS hosted the annual poster session titled
  <em>Sustainable Science &ndash; Recycle a Poster</em> at Bell's
  brewery downtown Kalamazoo on 5 Nov 2014. An unprecedented crowd of
  over 120 participants visited the local pub.
</p>
<p>
  For the first time KACS hosted an out-of-state speaker for this
  event series. The audience was excited to hear an engaging
  presentation by Prof. Tim Jamison from Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology. Jamison is known for his novel methods in organic
  synthesis and their implementation in the total synthesis of natural
  products. In his seminar on <em>Continuous Flow Multistep
  Synthesis</em> he outlined how flow chemistry holds so much
  potential to reduce reaction times and increase efficiency.
</p>
<p>
  Visitors had a chance to enjoy hot appetizers and beer while
  listening to the presentation, which was followed by the poster
  session. There were dozens of presenters, including 27
  students. Some posters were newly prepared or "recycled" from a
  previous conference. Poster contributions were based on research
  carried out at Carnegie Mellon University, Kalamazoo College, KAMSC,
  Michigan State University, Oklahoma State University, Rutgers
  University-Newark, Western Michigan University and
  Zoetis. Attendants were able to mingle, enjoy a relaxed atmosphere
  and continue informal discussions with Jamison and other scientists
  from academia and industry.
</p>
<p>
  This last event of the year was also an opportunity to thank all
  volunteers without whom KACS could not fulfill its goals and
  missions. For example, Dr. Lydia Hines received the ACS <em>2014
  Outreach Volunteer of the Year</em> award. The event was made
  possible through a generous grant by Zoetis.
