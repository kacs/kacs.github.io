<h2>Present Science, Network, Mingle, Celebrate Kalamazoo Chemistry</h2>

**Student poster presenters can win a prize!**

**Undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate.**

The Kalamazoo area has always been historically rich with exciting
chemistry. Please join us and share the area’s wealth of exciting
chemistry by bringing a poster of your chemistry accomplishments. Your
poster can either be newly prepared or a recycled poster from a
previous event. This Mixer invites local academic and industrial
chemists from all areas of chemistry: Analytical, Biochemistry,
Inorganic, Organic, and Physical, in addition to Food and Medicinal
Chemistry. See you there!  Present Science, Network, Mingle, Celebrate
Kalamazoo Chemistry

  This year KACS will host Professor Timothy F. Jamison (MIT) during
  its annual poster session. He will present a keynote speech on
  continuous flow chemistry. <b>Poster presenters should
  e-mail <a href="mailto:elke.schoffers@wmich.edu">
  elke.schoffers@wmich.edu</a> by Monday, November 3</b> to reserve an
  easel by sending: (a) the title of the poster, (b) a list of
  authors, and (c) institution information.

Continuous Flow Multistep Synthesis
---
#### by Keynote Speaker Prof. Tim Jamison (6 pm)
**Abstract:** Flow chemistry has the potential to revolutionize the
synthesis of organic molecules. Flow systems can reduce reaction
times, increase efficiency, and obviate problems often encountered in
scaling up. In addition to these important practical advantages, flow
chemistry expands the “toolbox” of organic reactions available to
scientists engaged in the synthesis of molecules – from small-scale
experiments to large-scale production. These benefits are a direct
result of several features of flow synthesis that batch synthesis
typically cannot achieve, for example, the ability to control fluid
flow precisely, the access to temperature and pressure regimes not
usually considered to be practical, and the enhanced safety
characteristics of flow chemical systems. In this lecture we will
discuss some of our investigations in this area in the form of case
studies, wherein a specific target or family of organic molecules has
served as an inspiration for the development of new methods of organic
synthesis in flow.
