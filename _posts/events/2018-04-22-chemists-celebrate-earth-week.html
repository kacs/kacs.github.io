  An <strong>early announcement</strong> about our section's
  participation in <em>Chemists Celebrate Earth Day</em>; we once
  again hope to have outreach events at the Celery Flats in Portage
  and at the Kalamazoo Nature Center, and at any other venues where we
  can have interested volunteers. Note that this outreach event is in
  its <strong>15th year</strong> and has been re-labeled <em>Chemists
    Celebrate Earth Week</em> (CCEW); it will be
  celebrated <strong>April 22-28, 2018</strong>, the topic
  is <em>Oceans</em> and the theme of the publication from the ACS
  Outreach office will be <em>Dive into Marine Chemistry</em>, which
  will discuss the chemistry of water from the ocean. The common goal
  for CCEW, as well as any other activity of our ACS, is to
  communicate the positive role that chemistry plays in the world.
