      Director of the Center for Green Chemistry and Green Engineering at
      Yale. Prof. Anastas returned to Yale in 2012 after serving as the
      Assistant Administrator for Research and Development and the Science
      Advisor at the Environmental Protection Agency after being appointed
      by President Barack Obama in 2009.  From 2004 -2006, Paul Anastas
      served as Director of the Green Chemistry Institute in Washington,
      D.C. He was previously the Assistant Director for the Environment in
      the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy where he
      worked from 1999-2004. Trained as a synthetic organic chemist,
      Dr. Anastas received his Ph.D. from Brandeis University. He is
      credited with <strong>establishing the field of green
	chemistry</strong> during his time working for the
      U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the Chief of the Industrial
      Chemistry Branch and as the Director of the U.S. Green Chemistry
      Program. He has been awarded the German Chemical
      Societyâ€™s <strong>W&ouml;hler Prize</strong> for his contributions to the
      design, discovery, and development of new chemistries and conceptual
      frameworks for advancing sustainability. He also holds prizes from
      the Council of Scientific Society Presidents (Leadership in Science
      Award).
