    The Kalamazoo section of the American Chemical Society held its
    forty-third annual awards program on Monday, May 9, 2016 in the
    chemistry building atrium on the campus of Western Michigan
    University. Awardees gathered along with family members, educators,
    and KACS members at 6pm for a reception with light hors
    d’oeuvres. The ceremony began at 6:45pm when KACS Chair Brian Eklov
    formally assembled all in attendance. Award presentations began with
    ACS 50+ members <strong>Al Blum</strong>, <strong>Herman
      W. Smith</strong>, and <strong>Roger G. Williams</strong> (pictures
    below). All three spoke briefly of their careers and love of
    chemistry. Additional 50-year members recognized but unable to
    attend were <strong>William E. Heyd</strong>, <strong>Gabe
      I. Kornis</strong>, <strong>Thomas L. Miller</strong>, and
    <strong>Ekkehard Sinn</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next up were the 60-year members! This year we recognized two
    chemists who have achieved this milestone. Both <strong>David G. Martin</strong> and
    <strong>Howard A. Whaley</strong> were present and briefly spoke of
    their professional experiences in the chemistry field (photographs
    below).
