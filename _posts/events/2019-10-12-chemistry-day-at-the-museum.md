      On October 12<sup>th</sup>, 2018 the 33<sup>rd</sup> Annual
      Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum drew 550 patrons for an
      early celebration of National Chemistry Week. Approximately 60
      volunteers presented 15 hands-on activities to the attendees.  The
      theme of 2019's National Chemistry Week is <em>Marvelous Metals</em>, and
      volunteers did a great job showcasing the theme with activities
      including a penny demo that heated a zinc coated penny to form
      brass, shiny pennies, using metals to clean up oil spills, magnets,
      metal detectors, and iron in cereal. At another table, members
      shared the significance of Kalamazoo's designation earlier this year
      as a National Historic Chemical Landmark for the development of
      steroid medicines at the Upjohn Company.

      KACS Volunteers from the Air Zoo, Kalamazoo Valley Museum,
      Pfizer, Perrigo, Kalsec, Kalexsyn, Western Michigan University,
      and Kalamazoo College, graciously volunteered their time to
      share these and other activities with the Kalamazoo community. A
      big THANK YOU to everyone that worked so hard to make this event
      a huge success. It is hard to describe the joy one experiences
      seeing the smile on young childrenâ€™s faces as they begin to
      understand the concepts behind these demonstrations. Hopefully
      some of these curious young attendees will remember this
      positive event when deciding a college major 5 to 10 years from
      now and choose the chemical sciences.

      <strong>Anyone willing to present a demo</strong> at the Museum Day
      event in early November 2020 send me an email
      (hjude[at]kalsec[dot]com) and I will stay in touch as next year's
      event approaches. The theme of 2020's National Chemistry week
      is <em>Sticking with Chemistry</em> (Glues and Adhesives).
