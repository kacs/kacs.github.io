    <h3>From Lipid Probes to Tuberculosis Drugs:
      Two Decades of Chemical Biology Research</h3>
    <p class="author">
      by Prof. Benjamin Swarts<br />
      Associate Professor<br />
      Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Central Michigan University
    </p>

    <p>
      Chemistry plays essential roles in understanding biology and
      creating new ways to combat human diseases. Ben Swarts, an
      Associate Professor at Central Michigan University, will
      discuss how chemical biology—the use of synthetic small
      molecules to study and manipulate biological systems—has
      been used in his research to explore novel approaches to
      diagnosing and treating the devastating bacterial disease
      tuberculosis. This story spans nearly two decades, ranging
      from Ben’s early experiences as an undergraduate chemistry
      major, through his time studying as a postdoc in South Africa,
      and to his current work as a chemistry professor and director
      of a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) tuberculosis research facility. It
      is hoped that this talk will illustrate how a passion for
      chemistry and a bit of serendipity can crystallize into an
      exciting, fruitful, and sometimes unpredictable career in the
      chemical sciences.

  On November 12 th the Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical
  Society (KACS) had another successful Recycle-A-Poster event
  sponsored by Zoetis at the Back room of Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute;
  in downtown Kalamazoo. Despite the unusually snowy weather on that
  day this highly-anticipated award-winning event, which occurs every
  fall and provides an opportunity for local chemists to talk science
  in a relaxed atmosphere over drinks and hors d'oeuvres, attracted
  about 70 participants. The evening started with a surprise
  presentation of a Tribute to the KACS by Senator Sean McCann in
  recognition of the International Year of the Periodic Table. That
  was followed by our keynote speaker, Dr. Benjamin Swarts of Central
  Michigan University, who gave an incredible talk on his career and
  his use of chemical biology to explore novel approaches to diagnose
  and treat tuberculosis. The program concluded with the opportunity
  to review the 26 "recycled" posters displayed by undergraduate
  students, graduate students as well as local industrial chemists; of
  those posters submitted by a publicized deadline three were
  randomly-selected as winners and each presenter received a $50 Visa
  gift card: Audrey Searing (WMU, NSF REU research at MSU),
  Christopher Vennard (Kalamazoo College, Chemistry), and Halle
  Nienhaus (WMU, Biological Sciences).  KACS is greatly indebted to
  Zoetis, our long-term sponsor for this annual event, and would also
  like to offer our sincere thanks to our speaker, Dr. Swarts, and the
  event coordinators, Drs. Tomasz Respondek (Zoetis) and Kelly Teske
  (WMU), for their diligent efforts in providing us with an amazing
  night!
