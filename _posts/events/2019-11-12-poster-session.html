    <h3>From Lipid Probes to Tuberculosis Drugs:
      Two Decades of Chemical Biology Research</h3>
    <p class="author">
      by Prof. Benjamin Swarts<br />
      Associate Professor<br />
      Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Central Michigan University
    </p>

    <p>
      Chemistry plays essential roles in understanding biology and
      creating new ways to combat human diseases. Ben Swarts, an
      Associate Professor at Central Michigan University, will
      discuss how chemical biology—the use of synthetic small
      molecules to study and manipulate biological systems—has
      been used in his research to explore novel approaches to
      diagnosing and treating the devastating bacterial disease
      tuberculosis. This story spans nearly two decades, ranging
      from Ben’s early experiences as an undergraduate chemistry
      major, through his time studying as a postdoc in South Africa,
      and to his current work as a chemistry professor and director
      of a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) tuberculosis research facility. It
      is hoped that this talk will illustrate how a passion for
      chemistry and a bit of serendipity can crystallize into an
      exciting, fruitful, and sometimes unpredictable career in the
      chemical sciences.
