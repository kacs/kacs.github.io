<h3>Celery Flats in Portage</h3>
<p>
  Spring arrived on and off in April and the forecast was for a sunny
  day on the 23rd; but the temperature was still in the 60s so our
  first experience at the Portage Green-a-thon was a pretty "cool"
  one. The event was very well organized by the Portage Youth Advisory
  committee and their liaison from the City Clerk's office. It was our
  first attempt at cooperation with them and we were very pleased to
  have made that contact. Lydia Hines, along with the expert help of
  Carl Stachew (well known to many in KACS, and others in the
  education circles, for his passion for science outreach to young
  people), and the enthusiasm of 4 Kalamazoo College Students, Ian
  Bunker, John Bailey, Sarah Glass and Joyce Nguyen saw 6 hours pass
  with never a dull moment as youngsters and their parents stopped
  by our table to make UV-sensitive-bead bracelets and to learn about
  carbon dioxide, its varied sources and uses, and to make chalk, as
  well as to get copies of Celebrating Chemistry to take home to
  continue "doing science experiments". A great experience overall,
  which I hope some of the readers of this newsletter will want to
  enjoy as we celebrate Earth Day in April of 2017!

<h3>Kalamazoo Nature Center</h3>
<p>
  This was our 6th year of participation with the Kalamazoo Nature
  Center during their Earth Day Celebration; Taylor Grace, Emily
  Hanner, Greg Johnson and Casey Wright from the WMU Chem Club were
  present at the opening of the event in the morning and were busy
  making chromatography flowers with youngsters and their parents who
  came by the KACS table. The steady flow of visitors continued
  through the afternoon when visitors could also avail themselves of
  our Celebrating Chemistry publication for their continued science
  enjoyment at home. K College students Myles Truss, Sangtawun Miller
  and Andrew Kaylor along with KACS chair Brian Eklov held down the
  fort during the afternoon hours.
