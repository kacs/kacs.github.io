  Our Michigan winter held off for several days in the last week of
  February so our celebration on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of that month was
  a less harrowing experience than it could have been; it was a
  fantastic one!

  The venue was the Kalamazoo Air Zoo where we had a delightful dinner
  catered by AV Catering, complete with the chef wearing an apron we
  gave him that said "Get Cooking with Chemistry"; we sat at tables in
  the shadow of the Zoo’s SR71B; we had four of the Air Zoo "rides"
  available to attendees of all ages (there were about 100 adult
  members and friends, and 39 children who attended); there was a buzz
  of conversation and great camaraderie. The program was streamlined
  so as not to be excessively long: cutting of the celebratory cake
  from Amy’s Cakes was followed by a lecture on the SR71B, the fastest
  airplane ever built, by Mr, John Boase, a docent at the Air Zoo,
  recognition of the 10 past chairs of the section who were present,
  recognition of members with 50- 60- and 70- years of membership in
  the ACS, ending with a very informative presentation on the ACS and
  its current emphases by its Executive Director and CEO, Dr. Thomas
  Connelly. Though none of the three members of our Section with 70+
  continuous years of ACS membership (Dr. Fred Kagan, 71 years,
  Dr. Harold Hart, 75 years, and Dr. Donald Iffland, 75 years) was
  able to attend, Dr. Connelly personally visited Dr. Iffland before
  arriving at our celebration to help with the set-up! The one 61-year
  member present, along with his wife, was Dr. Howard Whaley.

<p>
  A celebration such as this does not just "happen" - many of our
  current section members participated in its successful execution;
  special thanks go to James Kiddle and Sarut Jianrattanasawatt for
  arranging for the meal and the cakes; to Steve Secreast for
  supplying the continuously-running background power-point chemistry-
  and Section trivia-quiz and historical photos, the 7-foot banner
  with our logo and the pint glasses engraved with our logo, available
  to the first 100 registrants; to Andre Venter for keeping track of
  the reservations; to Mark Wolf for helping to set up the PayPal
  account for the event; to Christine Pruis for sending out our
  newsletters and other timely information; to Elke Schoffers for
  soliciting funds for the event and being the photographer; and to
  Brian Eklov and Lydia Hines for gathering archival information.
</p>

<p>
  We look forward to our 100th anniversary and the years leading up to
  that!
