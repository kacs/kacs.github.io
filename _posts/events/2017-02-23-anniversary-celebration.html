  Our Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical Society (KACS) will
  be celebrating its 75th anniversary with a dinner event on the main
  floor of the Air Zoo on the evening of Thursday, February 23, 2017,
  from 6-9:30 pm.
</p>
<p>
  We will have time to socialize, reminisce, celebrate our
  accomplishments, enjoy dinner, and be treated to a presentation on
  the SR-71. The Executive Director of the ACS will join our
  celebration, and we will have access to four of the Air Zoo's event
  experiences (including the simulators and the 4-D theater) for those
  who would like to take advantage of them!
</p>
<p>
  We hope you will join us at this family-friendly event. The cost
  for dinner for each attendee age 12 years and older will be $10.00
  (young people under 12 may come at no cost) so please plan to join
  fellow KACS members that evening for this special party!
