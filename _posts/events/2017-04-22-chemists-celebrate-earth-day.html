  It seems like Chemistry outreach events come around quite often!
  Every Spring brings Earth Day, celebrated on April 22; the American
  Chemical Society participation, now in its 15th year, coincides with
  that day. Local Sections are asked to conduct outreach activities in
  their communities, and our Kalamazoo Section has done that for all but
  the first (pilot) year.
</p>

<p>
  Each year we have offered activities and materials at the Kalamazoo
  Nature Center (KNC) during their Earth Day celebration; for two of the
  14 years we had an additional outreach event at the Oshtemo Branch of
  the Kalamazoo Pubic Library, and for the last two years, when the
  Library has not held an Earth-Day theme event, we have cooperated with
  the Green-a-thon experience at the Celery Flats in Portage.

  This year the theme of Chemist Celebrate Earth Day was "Chemistry
  helps feed the world". Also this year our Section has been fortunate
  to have a group of Chemistry students at Western Michigan University
  who have taken a keen interest in reaching out to young people with
  experiments which would engage them. These demos were done at The
  Celery Flats on Saturday, April 15 and at The KNC on Saturday, April
  22. They made chromatography flowers, and they worked with the
  patrons to identify starch in food-stuffs as well as other items in
  daily use; they also offered educational materials. Students who
  helped at the Kalamazoo Nature Center were Renae Mroczek, Megan
  Callaghan, Emily Hanners, Jessica Henderson, Erin Heath, Greg Johnson,
  Jake Kirkendall, Dyonna Almon, and Dejainara Davidson Those who worked
  at the Celery Flats event were Hervin Crespo-Sandoval, Jerome Davis
  Jr., Erin Heath, RenaeMroczek, Greg Johnson and Jessica Henderson.

  This year was unusual in that April 22 was also the day of a new
  activity, the March for Science, which in Kalamazoo ended at Bronson
  Park for the inaugural Kalamazoo Earth Day Celebration. The weather
  was perfect for the hundreds of attendees, who from 3-8 pm enjoyed
  music, food, science podium presentations and about 50 science-related
  exhibitors.

  KACS was there as a sponsor/exhibitor. Tom Runge, Doug Williams and
  Steve Secreast ran our KACS booth, which centered on a participatory
  green chem demo where we had people convert iodide in aqueous solution
  to I2 using just a 9-volt battery. Based on the volume of reagent we
  went through, we had at least 150 people try the demo. It was great
  fun watching people scoping us out as they walked by our booth, and
  then when we called them over and had them try it, seeing them really
  get into the whole thing. Was great too, seeing many people just
  wanting to talk about chemistry once we started speaking to them. We
  also had some giveaways that we handed out, the biggest hit being
  pocket periodic tables, which was cool to see.

  We received many thanks from the celebration organizers, in part for
  being a sponsor, but more for being one of the few exhibitors
  providing a demo for people to try. Talking chemistry and science is
  fun, but actually doing it is much better. Doug took the photo below
  of Tom and Steve in our booth. Additional photos of the celebration
  are available on the Celebrationâ€™s Facebook page at
