<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  It has been six years since our Section received a
  ChemLuminary Award [2007 for <em>Best on-going event for
    National Chemistry Week</em>].&nbsp; This year our
  self-nomination has brought us the designation of
  &ldquo;finalist&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Most
  Innovative New Activity or Program&rdquo; category. Out of 186
  Local Sections nationwide, we are thrilled to have been recognized in
  this category and thank all the donors and volunteers who helped us
  make this event a success (179 attendees).

<h2>Old Event Announcement</h2>
<strong>
  November 9, 2012, 6:30-9:30 PM<br />
  Kalamazoo Institute of Arts
</strong>

The Kalamazoo Local Section has received a small grant from the
American Chemical Society (ACS) to initiate a new program:
*Chemistry and Culture*. It is meant to highlight that chemists are
not just experts in their field but are also interested in art,
history, cooking, baking, brewing, sports and dancing, among others.

It is hoped that *Elements of Dance* will be the first event in a new series
