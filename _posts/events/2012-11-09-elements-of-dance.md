  The 2012 event was selected as a finalist for
  the <b>ChemLuminaryAward</b>! It has been six years since our
  Section received a ChemLuminary Award [2007 for <em>Best on-going
  event for National Chemistry Week</em>].&nbsp; This year our
  self-nomination has brought us the designation of
  &ldquo;finalist&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Most Innovative New Activity or
  Program&rdquo; category. Out of 186 Local Sections nationwide, we

<h2>Old Event Announcement 2012</h2>
<strong>
  9 November 2012 18:30-21:30<br />
  Kalamazoo Institute of Arts
</strong>

The Kalamazoo Local Section has received a small grant from the
American Chemical Society (ACS) to initiate a new program:
*Chemistry and Culture*. It is meant to highlight that chemists are
not just experts in their field but are also interested in art,
history, cooking, baking, brewing, sports and dancing, among others.

It is hoped that *Elements of Dance* will be the first event in a new series
