The Kalamazoo Local Section has received a small grant from the
American Chemical Society (ACS) to initiate a new program:
*Chemistry and Culture*. It is meant to highlight that chemists are
not just experts in their field but are also interested in art,
history, cooking, baking, brewing, sports and dancing, among others.

It is hoped that *Elements of Dance* will be the first event in a new series

No RSVP required. All are welcome but there is limited seating for the
brief program in the beginning, in addition to standing room. Contact

refreshments, displays and mingling in the KIA lobby. Showcases, a
dance lesson, a special demo and open dances take place in the
auditorium. There is no dress code. **We recommend your Sunday Best as

you will try. Hope to see you on Friday, November 9, 2012!
