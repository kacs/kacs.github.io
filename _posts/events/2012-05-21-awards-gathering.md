The KACS Education Committee — Donald Schreiber, James Kiddle, Sherine Obare, and Andre
Venter — with able assistance from Robin Lenkart, are to be commended for a fantastic evening
activity on May 21, Monday, in the WMU Chemistry Building atrium.

Outstanding college and high school students, our Section’s Competitive Exam winners, a high
school teacher, one ACS 50-year member and 10 past-chairs still living in the Kalamazoo area,
along with parents, siblings, teachers and a few Local Section members — 91 enthusiastic guests
in all — gathered at 6 p.m. After enjoying delicious snacks from Maggie’s catering service we
adjourned to the adjacent lecture hall where we had the award presentations:

- certificates, cheques and Merck Indexes to the high school awardees
- certificates and cheques to the college students
- certificate and cheque to the high school teacher (Mr. Al Nieboer, Kalamazoo Christian High School)
- a calligraphy-inscribed certificate to the ACS 50-year member (Dr. Jochanan Stenesh) and
- ACS past-chair lapel pins to 6 past-chairs [from 1971 to 2003]! (One more was given to the 1967 Past-chair at his home, and he, too, was delighted to receive it.)

It was a full and very rewarding evening; our young honorees heard
words of encouragement and wisdom from our more experienced members:
to study diligently, to overcome obstacles, to appreciate their
teachers and parents, to use their study of chemistry or any science
to benefit humanity, to make sure they continue to pass on their love
of science to younger acquaintances, to continue learning beyond the
“school experience,” and to focus on seeking employment which provides
them a means to do what they love and love what they do.

There are pictures on our website and some will be in the June 2012 Newsletter.
