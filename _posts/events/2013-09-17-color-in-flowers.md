    This presentation will describe the effect of pigments present in
    flowers and other parts of plants. The slides will show colors
    produced by the different types of pigments in flowers with the
    chemistry of these pigments described in "popular science" terms. That
    is, the average gardener should find this talk as informative as the
    average chemist. Flower pigments produce an amazing range of
    colors. Despite this, the bio-synthetic pathways of pigment production
    is very similar in all plant genera; this is true whether describing
    flowers or fruit or vegetables. This talk will describe carotenoid and
    anthocyanin pigments and their visual interactions to produce a range
    of colors. Pigment color is also modified by the chemical environment
    and its position in plant cells. There is a reason that no one has
    produced a blue rose or a blue daylily despite the presence of this
    color in other flowers.
