  <h2>The Exhibit</h2>

<p>
  With <strong>"Molecular Foundation of Movement"</strong> we
    will <strong>connect atoms and molecules to exercise
    science</strong>. Where is the chemistry?  Well, your muscles
    won't work unless you have iron, calcium and magnesium for
    example. Attendees can win a prize by completing a puzzle that is
    related to the information given in the exhibit.
</p>

<p>
  The exhibit includes a <strong>special tribute to the work of
  Dr. Alfred Bader</strong>, entrepreneur, fine arts collector and
  philanthropist.
</p>

<h2>Event Program</h2>

<p>
  There will be showcase dances with chemists, open dances, and line
  dances in the auditorium, among others. The exhibit and refreshments
  will be set up in the lobby. Everybody is asked to check in upon
  arrival. The full program can be downloaded

<p>
  Interested in studying up before the big day? Here are some videos
  demonstrating the <strong>group line dances</strong> that will take
  place. Don't worry, the steps will be described during the event as
  well.  The event is one day after Halloween. Feel free to wear your
  Sunday best or come in a Halloween costume.
