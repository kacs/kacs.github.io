  <h2>The Exhibit</h2>

<p>
  With <strong>"Molecular Foundation of Movement"</strong> we
    will <strong>connect atoms and molecules to exercise
    science</strong>. Where is the chemistry?  Well, your muscles
    won't work unless you have iron, calcium and magnesium for
    example. Attendees can win a prize by completing a puzzle that is
    related to the information given in the exhibit.
</p>

<p>
  The exhibit includes a <strong>special tribute to the work of
  Dr. Alfred Bader</strong>, entrepreneur, fine arts collector and
  philanthropist.
</p>

<h2>Event Program</h2>

<p>
  There will be showcase dances with chemists, open dances, and line
  dances in the auditorium, among others. The exhibit and refreshments
  will be set up in the lobby. Everybody is asked to check in upon
  arrival. The full program can be downloaded
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/elements-of-dance/eod-2013-program.pdf"

</p>

<p>
  Interested in studying up before the big day? Here are some videos
  demonstrating the <strong>group line dances</strong> that will take
  place. Don't worry, the steps will be described during the event as
  well.  The event is one day after Halloween. Feel free to wear your
  Sunday best or come in a Halloween costume.

  The connection between chemistry and culture, especially chemistry
  and dance may not be obvious to everybody. However, there are some
  interesting aspects to consider when contemplating these
  combinations.
  <a href="http://www.johnbohannon.org" title="John Bohannon homepage">
    John Bohannon</a>, a biologist and science journalist, has
  collaborated with AAAS to create the <em>Dance Your PhD</em>
  competition. It is in response to a dreaded situation that
  scientists encounter whey they try to explain their research to
  laymen. How does one respond to &lqduo;So, what’s your PhD
  about?&rdquo; For the fourth year running, PhD scientists can
  compete to win up to $1,000, and they are required to
  dance. Bohannon has also performed at
  <a href="http://www.tedxbrussels.eu/" title="TEDx Brussels Website">
    TEDx Brussels</a>. With the help of the Black Label Movement dance
  troupe he proposed to replace Powerpoint software with live
  dancers. Zafra M. Lerman of the <em>Institute for Science Education
  and Science Communication</em> thinks that the &ldquo;arts can play a
  valuable role in reversing [a negative] public perception&rdquo; and help
  &ldquo;improve the public understanding of chemistry&rdquo; (<em>Chemistry: An
  Inspiration for Theatre and Dance</em> Chemical Education
  International, Vol. 6, No. 1, 2005). A notable example is the
  play <em>Oxygen</em>, written by Carl Djerassi and Nobel laureate Roald
  Hoffmann. And “Nobel laureate John Planyi has referred to molecular
  movement as ‘the dance of the molecules’”.
</p>
<p>
  On November 1, over 200 people were curious enough to find out about
  <strong>dancing chemists</strong> when KACS <strong>connected atoms
  and molecules to exercise science</strong> in the lobby, while
  offering showcase dances, line dances and open dances in the
  auditorium of the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts during <em>Chemistry and
  Culture: Elements of Dance</em>. Mayor Bobby Hopewell was the "Surprise
  Celebrity MC".
</P>
<p>
  Many chemists dressed in elegant evening attire and joined local
  ballroom dancers and the general public. The lobby featured
  refreshments and several displays as part of an exhibit that
  explained exercise chemistry:
  <ul>
    <li>Amino Acids, Peptides, Proteins, and Endorphins</li>
    <li>Doping in Sports</li>
    <li>Steroids</li>
    <li>Chemicals Used in Sports Attire</li>
    <li>Chemistry, Body Odor and Pheromones</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Participants were able to win prizes. For example, correct crossword
  puzzles, based on the science in the exhibit, were entered into a
  drawing for trial gym memberships, T-shirts, Meg-A- Moles, and dance
  passes, among others.

      There was also a computer set up which played a YouTube video of
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg54Tp85S-Y"
	 title="ACS Dancing Video on Youtube"> “Chemists Can DANCE! The
	first ever dancing periodic table of elements”
      </a>, which was produced by ACS. A demo showed how one can isolate
      iron from cereal. Last but not least, there was a display as a
      special tribute to Dr. Alfred Bader, founder of Aldrich Chemicals
      and an avid art collector and philanthropist. This event was made
      possible through generous donations by AAAS, WMU, Aldrich
      Chemistry, Alfred Bader Fine Arts, and WMU-BTR. It was also a
      collaboration of KACS with the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts,
      Southwest Michigan Ballroom Dance and the Kalamazoo Chapter of USA
      Dance.
