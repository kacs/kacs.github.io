  <h2>The Exhibit</h2>

<p>
  With <strong>"Molecular Foundation of Movement"</strong> we
    will <strong>connect atoms and molecules to exercise
    science</strong>. Where is the chemistry?  Well, your muscles
    won't work unless you have iron, calcium and magnesium for
    example. Attendees can win a prize by completing a puzzle that is
    related to the information given in the exhibit.
</p>

<p>
  The exhibit includes a <strong>special tribute to the work of
  Dr. Alfred Bader</strong>, entrepreneur, fine arts collector and
  philanthropist.
</p>

<h2>Event Program</h2>

<p>
  There will be showcase dances with chemists, open dances, and line
  dances in the auditorium, among others. The exhibit and refreshments
  will be set up in the lobby. Everybody is asked to check in upon
  arrival. More details will be posted soon.

<h2>Why Chemistry and Culture?</h2>
<p>
  Chemists are not just experts in their field but are also interested
  in art, history, cooking, baking, brewing, gardening and exercise,
  among others. <strong>“Elements of Dance”</strong> invites all
  chemists, chemistry enthusiasts and the general public to enjoy
  ballroom dancing. Future “Chemistry and Culture” themes will address
  topics like “Art Conservation”, “Forgery”, “Cooking” and “Gardening”,
  for example.
</p>

<p>
  The goals of the "Chemistry and Culture" series are...
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      To offer a social networking opportunity for members of the
      Kalamazoo Local Section of the American Chemical Society (KACS)
      and the public
    </li>
    <li>
      To educate the general public about the goals and activities of KACS
    </li>
    <li>To highlight the connections between "chemistry" and "culture"</li>
    <li>To encourage student participation</li>
    <li>
      To instill an appreciation for how chemistry contributes to the
      world in many ways
    </li>
    <li>To forge ties with the local community</li>
  </ul>
