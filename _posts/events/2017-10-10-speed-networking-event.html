<p>
  Local American Chemical Society (KACS) members and students interested
  in Chemistry are invited to attend a fun and interactive networking
  event. Co-hosted by the Center for Career and Professional
  Development, Kalamazoo College Chemistry Department and the American
  Chemical Society Kalamazoo Chapter.
</p>

<p>
  The premise for this event is to connect local chemistry college
  students (WMU, K Col, KVCC) with local working chemists for
  information sharing. The set up will be like that for speed dating,
  with participating chem students rotating through 5 minute (or so) sit
  downs with participating working chemists, the students asking
  questions related to chem careers, the working chemists providing
  answers/information based on personal experience. KACS has been asked
  to provide members to serve as a diverse working chemist panel. This
  is a great, painless, low time commitment opportunity for us to share
  our knowledge and experience with chem university students looking to
  start their careers.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you are a potential mentor (experienced individual who can
  advise &amp; guide on potential career paths) OR a student interested in
  meeting with chemistry professionals, please join us for this
  gathering!
