<h2>29<sup>th</sup> National Chemistry Week Report</h2>

  Once again, cold weather arrived early in Kalamazoo, Michigan, just
  in time for our much-anticipated National Chemistry Week (NCW)
  hands-on-chemistry outreach to our community! It was a good
  opportunity to stay indoors, so 1000 patrons (children and families)
  visited our chemistry-themed activities in our area’s two-storey
  museum and the Volcano demonstration outside the building, on
  Saturday, October 17, 2015, from noon to 4 pm. Our long-time
  partner, the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, diligently added extensive
  publicity in the print media (5 venues), in 2 TV shows, and on
  several FM and AM radio programs to our online flyers sent to
  schools, libraries and other targeted audience groups.
</p>
<p>
  Among our visitors were one family from Grand Rapids who heard the
  ad on TV :), two large Girl Scout groups and several area teachers
  who eagerly took ACS's American Association of Chemistry Teachers
  (AACT) information, as well as home-schooling families, who were
  delighted with all the age-appropriate information we had available
  for them - Celebrating Chemistry and ChemMatters.
</p>
<p>
  As in other years, enthusiasm among both KACS members and other volunteers continued to build
  as the event neared, and our accommodating colleague at the Museum, Mrs. Annette Hoppenworth,
expertly fit in 80 volunteers presenting 25 activities. “Worker bees” for the duration of the event
included many High School students, undergraduates and graduate students, local industry
representatives, college and university faculty and others who just enjoy seeing the excitement
  registered on visitors’ faces each year.
</p>
<p>
  Sincere appreciation is extended to each one who made this event another HUGE success.

  Note: What follows is a story about how our Section's programs work
  hand in hand to continue giving: Readers should be aware of our
  Local section's 33-year history of administering a Competitive Exam
  followed by an Awards Program; well, as I was looking over the names
  of the High School young people who, over the past several years,
  have been given awards by our Section for their exemplary
  performance on our Competitive Examination, I came across four names
  that sounded very familiar because they appeared on the list of
  volunteers at our 2015 Chemistry Day &ndash; one was that of Sarah Glass,
  a 2013 awardee, a graduate of Wayland (MI) High School, and the
  other 3 were Hannah McQueen, Josiah Turpin, and Chris Vennard, 2015
  awardees. Sarah is now studying chemistry at Kalamazoo College and
  is one of the leaders of the Chemistry club on that campus; as such
  she has been instrumental in organizing and enlisting a group of her
  fellow students to present activities at our Chemistry Day at the
  Museum both this year and last. The other three are 2015 awardees
  and continue as students at Gull Lake High School. It is exciting to
  see these young people enthusiastically participating in an activity
  that shares the importance and fun of chemistry with the younger
  generation.

<hr />

<p>Dear friends, colleagues and fellow-members of the ACS:</p>
<p>National Chemistry Week (NCW) is coming up soon! <b>Please join the fun!</b></p>
<p>
  NCW will be celebrated this year during the week of October 18-24,
  and its theme this year is "Chemistry Colors Our World!" exploring
  the chemistry of dyes, pigments, and light. The Kalamazoo Section's
  largest and most extensive annual outreach to the community is our
  <strong>Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum</strong> (KVM) on <strong>October 17,
  from 12 to 4 pm</strong>. During the Chemistry Day event, our members
  and friends spend 4 hours on a Saturday afternoon presenting
  chemistry-related hands-on activities to many young people and their
  families who come to visit the museum and to learn about the joys
  and impacts of chemistry and its usefulness.  Many visitors will
  receive materials to take home and read, do and share with their
  parents, teachers and friends. Annette Hoppenworth and her staff at
  the KVM work hard to assure the success of this outreach event, and
  their commitment is critical to the event's success.
</p>

<p>
  Dr. Lydia M. Hines has stepped down, after 27(!) years of tireless
  service, as our local coordinator for NCW. Dr. John B. Miller will
  be taking over the reins. Please contact him to let him know what
  activity you would like to present at <strong>269-387-2871</strong>
  or <a href="mailto:john.b.miller@wmich.edu" title="E-mail John Miller">
    john.b.miller@wmich.edu</a>. There is a modest budget for
  the event, so if you will need assistance with purchase of materials
  inform John of the need and the approximate expense when you contact
  him.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for helping youth get excited about Chemistry!
