<h2 id="ncw-announcement">Call for Volunteers: National Chemistry Week</h2>
<p>
 First call for volunteers for our 2015 National Chemistry Week (NCW)
 outreach event at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum. We count on you to
 volunteer your time and engaging disposition for its success again
 this year!
</p>

<p>Dear friends, colleagues and fellow-members of the ACS:</p>
<p>National Chemistry Week (NCW) is coming up soon! <b>Please join the fun!</b></p>
<p>
  NCW will be celebrated this year during the week of October 18-24,
  and its theme this year is "Chemistry Colors Our World!" exploring
  the chemistry of dyes, pigments, and light. The Kalamazoo Section's
  largest and most extensive annual outreach to the community is our
  <strong>Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum</strong> (KVM) on <strong>October 17,
  from 12 to 4 pm</strong>. During the Chemistry Day event, our members
  and friends spend 4 hours on a Saturday afternoon presenting
  chemistry-related hands-on activities to many young people and their
  families who come to visit the museum and to learn about the joys
  and impacts of chemistry and its usefulness.  Many visitors will
  receive materials to take home and read, do and share with their
  parents, teachers and friends. Annette Hoppenworth and her staff at
  the KVM work hard to assure the success of this outreach event, and
  their commitment is critical to the event's success.
</p>

<p>
  Dr. Lydia M. Hines has stepped down, after 27(!) years of tireless
  service, as our local coordinator for NCW. Dr. John B. Miller will
  be taking over the reins. Please contact him to let him know what
  activity you would like to present at <strong>269-387-2871</strong>
  or <a href="mailto:john.b.miller@wmich.edu" title="E-mail John Miller">
    john.b.miller@wmich.edu</a>. There is a modest budget for
  the event, so if you will need assistance with purchase of materials
  inform John of the need and the approximate expense when you contact
  him.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for helping youth get excited about Chemistry!
