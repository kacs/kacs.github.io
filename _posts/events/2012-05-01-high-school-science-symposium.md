Four High Schools in Southwest Michigan brought about 100 eager
students and their teachers to our KACS HS Science Symposium on May 1,
2012; it was hosted in the Chemistry Building of the Chemistry
Department at Western Michigan University (WMU). The Schools
represented were Kalamazoo Central, Saugatuck, Homer, and Gull Lake.

The students and teachers arrived at 9 a.m. and were treated to a
presentation by representatives of the new WMU Medical School who
impressed them with the lengthy process and persistence required to
become a practicing physician; they were also made aware that a high
GPA and MCAT scores do not guarantee entry to Medical School. For the
remainder of their stay the students were able to choose among tours
to the WMU Imaging Center or the WMU Linear Accelerator Laboratory,
observe a glass-blowing demonstration, and attend other keynote
addresses in three parallel sessions on topics such as Alternative
fuels, Nanomaterials and their use, Veterinary medicine, Frontiers in
tissue engineering, Neurobiology of the sense of smell, Food color
chemistry (with samples), Microbial Biodiversity, and Our Place in the
Universe.

No program for students would be complete without donut holes and
fruit drinks Appreciation was palpable. Sincere thanks go to the Local
Sectionâ€™s Education Committee (Dr.  Don Schreiber, Dr. James Kiddle,
Dr. Sherine Obare, and Dr. Andre Venter) and to Section members and
non-members* for their joyful generosity of time and expertise.
