## Guest Speaker: Chemistry on Stamps
### Prof. Daniel Rabinovich

Postage stamps constitute a simple yet effective means of
communication, often used by governments or postal authorities to
inform or engage the general public on a variety of topics, including
history, geography, literature and the arts. A surprisingly large
number of stamps have also been issued to commemorate scientific
discoveries or to honor well-known scientists.  This presentation will
feature postage stamps and other philatelic materials pertaining to
the history of chemistry, the discovery and sources of the elements,
chemical structures and formulas, laboratory equipment, biochemistry,
and various aspects of the chemical industry.

Sponsored by the Department of Chemistry and the Kalamazoo Section of
the American Chemical Society
