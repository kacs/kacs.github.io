    Maren Zanotti again spearheaded the Section's participation at the
    Kalamazoo Nature Center, which coincided with the Centerâ€™s Earth Day
    celebration on Saturday, April 18. From 8:30am to 4pm Students from
    WMU and Kalamazoo College chemistry clubs worked in tandem to
    distribute copies of an activity-packed theme-related publication,
    <i>Celebrating Chemistry</i>, titled &ldquo;Climate Science: More than just a
    Weather Report&rdquo; and developed by the American Chemical Society, and
    to help youngsters make chromatography butterflies. As always,
    families were most appreciative of the science-related information
    and hands-on project.

    The following Saturday, April 25, was a cold, overcast day, so the
    &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; program planned by the Oshtemo Branch of the
    Kalamazoo Public Library was moved indoors. The library staff
    arranged for us to have a table in the entrance hallway, and as in
    previous years it gave us a great opportunity to interact with the
    families that were there for the planned Music event. Brian Eklov
    and Lydia Hines were able to draw in about 50 children with demos of
    &ldquo;Magic Sand"rdquo:, color-changing beads, and
    &ldquo;indicator&rdquo; demonstrations. Parents happily followed
    their children to our table and copies of <i>Celebrating
      Chemistry</i> were gratefully received; the first patron at our
    table was a 4 th grade science teacher and she was so excited to
    hear about our KACS offerings through the year!
