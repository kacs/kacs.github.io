On Friday, June 8, the Chemistry Graduate Student Association (CGSA)
at Western Michigan University (WMU) hosted its second annual barbeque
for local chemists at Oshtemo Township Park. Members of the Department
of Chemistry at Western Michigan University and KACS were invited to
join the graduate students for an afternoon of food, fun, and
festivities; 37 people attended. Hamburgers, veggie burgers, and
assorted side dishes were provided. Activities included a soccer game,
disk golf, Frisbee, and football. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves,
with over 90% of the attendees staying for at least two of the three
hours that the barbeque lasted. Given the positive outcome of this
event, CGSA would like to host another barbeque next year.

One of the primary purposes of the barbeque is to promote the
interaction between graduate students and other chemists, both within
WMU and the Kalamazoo area.  Though most of this yearâ€™s participants
were affiliated with WMU, the graduate students hope that more non-WMU
affiliated chemists will attend in subsequent years.
