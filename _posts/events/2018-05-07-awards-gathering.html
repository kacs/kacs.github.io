  The young people were present in fine attire on a lovely May Monday
  afternoon in the foyer of the Chemistry Building on the WMU campus,
  along with teachers, friends and/or parents, to receive awards based
  on achievements in their chemistry studies.
</p>
<p>
  It was our section's 45th annual Awards Gathering where we recognize
  high school students and teachers, as well as college students,
  section members who have served the American Chemical Society for
  many years, and others in the community and of our membership whose
  contributions have been noteworthy.  This year for the first time we
  also recognized our Project SEED student, Victor Plascencia
  (Comstock HS), and Kalamazoo College's Dr. Dwight Williams, his
  mentor over the 10-week summer research program,
</p>
<p>
  Though none of our six long-time members (1-50 years, 2-60 years,
  1-70 years, and 2-76 years) was able to be with us, our councilor,
  Lydia E. M. Hines, did present a recognition certificate to
  Dr. Donald Iffland at his home that afternoon; a retiree from the
  WMU Chemistry Department he served as Section chairman in 1967 and
  1968.  Our member volunteer for his able and willing service for
  many years was Dr. James Kiddle.  This year we also gave awards to
  two of our Section's HS teachers for their many years of instilling
  enthusiasm for chemistry in their students â€“ Mr. Brad Portis at Gull
  Lake HS and Mrs. Doreen Odziana at Paw Paw HS. A separate short
  description is given in a separate article regarding the
  Salute-to-Excellence award given to the Kalamazoo Public Library's
  representative Susan Warner.
