      <p>
	As reported in KACS Newsletters last year, we're excited that
	ACS is awarding National Historic Chemical Landmark (NHCL)
	designation to the 1950-1990 steroid chemistry work of Kalamazoo
	scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
	Information about this designation is available in
	our <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/kalamazoo_valley_museum_to_display_american_chemical_society_s_national_historical_landmark_plaque/prweb15794300.htm">
	  2018 news release</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	And information about the ACS NHCL program is available on the
	<a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks.html">ACS website</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	To celebrate this achievement, the Kalamazoo NHCL Organizing
	Committee has been planning a Kalamazoo NHCL Dedication Event
	for April-May 2019. The committee has been hard a work at work
	putting together a quality event program.

    Upjohn Company scientists, Kalamazoo Pfizer scientists
    continue today making breakthrough discoveries. Because of the
    proprietary nature of the work that will be presented, this
    symposium will not be open to the public, but all Pfizer
    colleagues are highly encouraged to attend. Please contact

    What's the first thing our NHCL Organizing Committee
    decided that we should do to celebrate the Kalamazoo
    Landmark designation? Throw a party. With opportunity to
    get together with friends, family and former colleagues of
    the Kalamazoo chemistry community, to recognize and
s    honor this achievement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This May 16th dinner and reception at the Radisson is that
    party. We will be having a buffet dinner and cash bar. And
    we're excited with the special guests that have agreed to
    make presentations.

	We're extremely pleased that Dr. Edward J. Hessler
	has agreed to attend and speak about the Kalamazoo
	steroid chemistry work. Ed, currently President of
	Bridge Organics, was Vice President and General
	Manager of The Upjohn Company's Fine Chemicals
	Division in 1990. As a synthetic chemist at The Upjohn
	Company, he was directly involved in the steroid
	chemistry work in the 1980's, including synthesis of
	corticosteroids from 17-keto steroids. With his first-hand
	experience and knowledge, Ed is the perfect choice for
	helping us remember the landmark steroid chemistry.

      <h2 class="speaker">Dr. Eric Matteson</h2>
      <p>
	When we submitted the NHCL application in 2017, ACS asked if
	there were any related significant anniversaries that would be
	occurring about the time of our 2019 planned dedication
	event. The one that stood out is that 2019 is the
	70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the 1949 Mayo Clinic studies
	that demonstrated cortisone was a safe and effective medicine,
	for treating inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid
	arthritis. It was that medical breakthrough that sent The
	Upjohn Company in earnest, down the path of steroid chemistry
	discovery and product development. Given that anniversary, our
	Organizing Committee thought it would be great to have our
	keynote presentation come from someone familiar with the Mayo
	Clinic work.
      </p>
      <p>
	Enter Dr. Eric Matteson, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic College of
	Medicine, Division of Rheumatology and Department of Health
	Sciences Research. Upon finding that Eric is co-author of a
	very interesting paper entitled: Rheumatology Practice at Mayo
	Clinic: The First 40 Years – 1920 to 1960 (<em>Mayo Clin
	Proc., 85(4), e17-e30, April 2010</em>), which discusses the
	Mayo cortisone work of the late 1940's, we reached out to him
	regarding potentially being our keynote speaker. To our great
	pleasure, turns out Eric did a residency in Kalamazoo early in
	his career, and he immediately agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
	Eric's keynote presentation will be: The Discovery and First
	Use of Cortisone for Rheumatoid Arthritis at Mayo Clinic. We
	look forward to seeing him here in the Zoo in May.

  <h1 id="symposium">Landmark Dedication Chemistry Symposium and Ceremony</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>
      17 May 2019, 7:30am-4pm<br />
      <em>Chemistry in Kalamazoo &ndash; Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</em><br />
      Kalamazoo Valley Museum, 230 N. Rose St., Kalamazoo, MI 49007<br />
      1st floor Atrium & Mary Jane Stryker Auditorium<br />
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Organizing Committee started planning the local
    dedication event early in 2018, we knew right from the start that
    it would be a great opportunity to showcase not only Kalamazoo
    chemistry history, but also some the excellent chemistry work
    going on in Kalamazoo today and looking into the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    We saw a one-day symposium at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, free and open to the
    public, with multiple speakers from the Kalamazoo chemistry community as a very
    special way to help celebrate the National Historic Chemical Landmark Dedication. Our
    proposal was met with great support.
  </p>
  <p>
    The theme of the symposium is <em>Chemistry in Kalamazoo &ndash;
      Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</em>. The morning session will
      focus on <em>yesterday</em>, with presentations covering
      different aspects of the Kalamazoo 1950-1990 steroid chemistry
      work. The afternoon session will focus on <em>today and
      tomorrow</em>, with presentations highlighting current and
      future chemistry work going on in various Kalamazoo industrial
      and academic organizations. In between the two sessions will be
      the formal Kalamazoo National Historic Chemical Landmark
      dedication.

  <h1 id="organizing-committee">Kalamazoo National Historic Chemical Landmark Organizing Committee</h1>
  <p>
    The journey to gaining National Historic Chemical Landmark
    recognition for Kalamazoo steroid chemistry work, began in the
    spring of 2017 when two events coincided unexpectedly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
	First, was the discovery of a paper published in 1992 in the
	scientific journal Steroids (volume 57, pages 593-616),
	entitled <em>Steroids, the steroid community, and Upjohn in
	  perspective: a profile of innovation</em>. This well-written
	article by Dr. John A. Hogg, who retired in 1981 from The Upjohn
	Company as Director of Experimental Sciences and Therapeutics,
	reads like a novel explaining in detail the truly innovative,
	world-class chemistry that was discovered and developed in
	Kalamazoo from the 1950s to the 1990s.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <img src="/images/events/historic-landmark-2019/steroid-paper.jpg" alt="Steroid paper" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <img src="/images/events/historic-landmark-2019/edison-plaque.jpg" alt="Edison landmark" />
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
      Then second, while
	viewing the Thomas Edison Menlo Park Lab exhibit at the Henry
	Ford museum,
	the <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/thomas-edison.html">ACS
	  National Historic Chemical Landmark</a> bronze plaque there
	honoring Edison's work was spotted, and curiosity drove learning
      more about the ACS Historic Landmark program.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    These two events happening together created the realization that
    the Kalamazoo steroid chemistry work should be part of the
    National Historic Chemical Landmark program. From there, the
    summer of 2017 was spent researching the past work, putting
    together a proposal. Much of the proposal content came from John
    Hogg's review article, and the wealth
    of <a href="http://upjohn.net" >historic Upjohn information</a>
    made available by Jeremy Winkworth. The success of the application
    was due in large part to them documenting and making available
    that history.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also very helpful, were letters of support provided
    by Dr. Edwin Vedejs (University of Michigan) and Dr. Scott
    E. Denmark (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The
    Kalamazoo Valley Museum offering to be the public landmark sponsor
    was also key. As was support provided by The Apjohn Group.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application was submitted by the Kalamazoo ACS Local Section
    in July 2017, and it flew through the ACS National review process
    with first-round approval coming in November 2017 (providing a
    testament to the recognized importance of the work). We spent 2018
    expanding our planning committee and working with ACS and the
    Kalamazoo chemistry community, to put together a worthy dedication
    event and commemorative materials. Now here in 2019, we are very
    proud to see this National Historic Chemical Landmark dedication
    recognizing the work of Kalamazoo scientists. We think that all of
    Kalamazoo should be proud.
