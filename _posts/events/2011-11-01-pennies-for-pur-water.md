During the International Year of Chemistry in 2011, the ACS Kalamazoo
Local Section (KACS) collected PURR Water donations at the beginning
of each Executive Committee meeting and at several Local Section
events such as the SciMix Poster Session titled “Sustainable Science –
Recycle a Poster”, the ACS tour speaker presentation “Chemistry and
Biochemistry of Chocolate: Is Chocolate really good for you?” with
subsequent tasting of local truffles, and at the Chemistry Day at the
Kalamazoo Valley Museum as part of the National Chemistry Week
celebration. The total contribution was $60.00. These donations
supplied 1,714 packets (at 3.5&cent; each) for a total contribution of
4,826 gal of potable water through ACS’s partnership with Procter &
Gamble’s Children’s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) Coalition.
