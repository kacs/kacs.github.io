<h2>
  Inhibition of an erythrocyte tyrosine kinase prevents Plasmodium
  falciparum egress and terminates parasitemia
</h2>

    <p>
      According to the World Health Organization, one child dies from
      malaria every minute, and half of the world's population remains
      at risk of infection. Because this threat is expected to rise as
      drug resistance continues to eliminate established treatment
      options, the search for novel anti-malarial therapies has
      intensified. Here we describe a therapy that
      prevents <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> from inducing the
      phosphorylation of erythrocyte band 3 by an erythrocyte tyrosine
      kinase, among others. At a time when drug resistant strains of
      <i>P. falciparum</i> are continually emerging, a therapy that targets a
      host enzyme that cannot be mutated by the parasite could lead to a
      mutation-resistant treatment for this devastating disease.

<h2>Karson S. Putt &ndash; Biosketch</h2>

<p>
 Karson is a Purdue graduate from the IPFW campus where he received
 degrees in biology and chemistry. He then pursued a
 M.D./Ph.D. degree program at the University of Illinois at
 Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), however after 2 years of medical school he
 decided to solely pursue his research activities. His research
 focused on studying the cell death pathways encompassing apoptosis
 and necrosis through identifying small molecule modulators of known
 and novel cellular targets via high-throughput screening. His work
 touched on many different disease areas including oncology,
 neurodegeneration, ischemia/reperfusion injuries and
 anti-microbials. During his 4 years in the lab of Paul
 Hergenrother, his discovery efforts led to the publication of 13
 articles (peaking with the October 2006 cover story in Nature
 Chemical Biology), the filing of 11 U.S. patents, the creation of
 one startup company and the out-licensing of 4 other classes of
 molecules to various pharmaceutical/biotech companies. One of these
 molecules, PAC-1, is currently in Phase I human clinical trials.
</p>
<p>
 After he graduated with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, he became the
 director of the UIUC high-throughput screening facility where he
 created the facility from scratch with a small NIH facility grant.
 This HTS facility provided assistance, compound libraries and the
 equipment required to screen purified biomolecules, crude cellular
 lysates, whole bacterial cells and whole mammalian cells for inter-
 and intra-university researchers along with small biotech companies.
</p>
<p>
 Karson then took a position with Johnson &amp; Johnson where he created
 another high-throughput screening facility at J&amp;J's Jacksonville
 site. In this role, he managed the HTS and combinatorial chemistry
 lab which was tasked to identify drugs/biomarkers, create
 combination (drug + device) products and study the fundamental
 physiological interactions between cells/tissues and newly
 identified drugs, materials and medical devices. During his time
 with J&amp;J, Karson was able to publish 3 journal articles and was an
 inventor on 28 filed U.S. patents.
</p>
<p>
 Currently, Karson is the managing director of the Purdue University
 Center for Drug Discovery. The Center comprises over 100 faculty
 and 700 researchers whose work has resulted in over 40 therapeutic
 agents in the Purdue pipeline, 15 of which are in human clinical
 trials. He oversees the day to day operations of the Center and
 provides subject matter expertise to the wide variety of research
 being performed within the Center and by affiliated faculty.
