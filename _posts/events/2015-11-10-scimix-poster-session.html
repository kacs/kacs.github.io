  <h2>
    Inhibition of an Erythrocyte Tyrosine Kinase
      Prevents <em>plasmodium falciparum</em> Egress and Terminates
      Parasitemia

	According to the World Health Organization, one child dies from
	malaria every minute, and half of the world's population remains
	at risk of infection. Because this threat is expected to rise as
	drug resistance continues to eliminate established treatment
	options, the search for novel anti-malarial therapies has
	intensified. Here we describe a therapy that
	prevents <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> from inducing the
	phosphorylation of erythrocyte band 3 by an erythrocyte tyrosine
	kinase, among others. At a time when drug resistant strains of
	<i>P. falciparum</i> are continually emerging, a therapy that targets a
	host enzyme that cannot be mutated by the parasite could lead to a
	mutation-resistant treatment for this devastating disease.

  <h2>Karson S. Putt &ndash; Biosketch</h2>

  <p>
    Karson is a Purdue graduate from the IPFW campus where he received
    degrees in biology and chemistry. He then pursued a
    M.D./Ph.D. degree program at the University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), however after 2 years of medical school he
    decided to solely pursue his research activities. His research
    focused on studying the cell death pathways encompassing apoptosis
    and necrosis through identifying small molecule modulators of known
    and novel cellular targets via high-throughput screening. His work
    touched on many different disease areas including oncology,
    neurodegeneration, ischemia/reperfusion injuries and
    anti-microbials. During his 4 years in the lab of Paul
    Hergenrother, his discovery efforts led to the publication of 13
    articles (peaking with the October 2006 cover story in Nature
    Chemical Biology), the filing of 11 U.S. patents, the creation of
    one startup company and the out-licensing of 4 other classes of
    molecules to various pharmaceutical/biotech companies. One of these
    molecules, PAC-1, is currently in Phase I human clinical trials.
  </p>
  <p>
    After he graduated with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, he became the
    director of the UIUC high-throughput screening facility where he
    created the facility from scratch with a small NIH facility grant.
    This HTS facility provided assistance, compound libraries and the
    equipment required to screen purified biomolecules, crude cellular
    lysates, whole bacterial cells and whole mammalian cells for inter-
    and intra-university researchers along with small biotech companies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Karson then took a position with Johnson &amp; Johnson where he created
    another high-throughput screening facility at J&amp;J's Jacksonville
    site. In this role, he managed the HTS and combinatorial chemistry
    lab which was tasked to identify drugs/biomarkers, create
    combination (drug + device) products and study the fundamental
    physiological interactions between cells/tissues and newly
    identified drugs, materials and medical devices. During his time
    with J&amp;J, Karson was able to publish 3 journal articles and was an
    inventor on 28 filed U.S. patents.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, Karson is the managing director of the Purdue University
    Center for Drug Discovery. The Center comprises over 100 faculty
    and 700 researchers whose work has resulted in over 40 therapeutic
    agents in the Purdue pipeline, 15 of which are in human clinical
    trials. He oversees the day to day operations of the Center and
    provides subject matter expertise to the wide variety of research
    being performed within the Center and by affiliated faculty.

	KACS hosted its annual poster session titled
	"Sustainable Science - Recycle a Poster" at Bell's
	Eccentric Café in downtown Kalamazoo on Nov. 10,
	2015. This event is now in its fifth year and was made
	possible through a generous grant from Zoetis. It not
	only features research posters but typically also hosts a
	keynote speaker during this very social gathering.
	Poster setup, registration and mingling began at 5 PM.
	Over 70 people enjoyed the atmosphere of this public
	event; 51% of the attendees were ACS members.

	The audience was excited to learn about the latest efforts to
	control and cure malaria from the keynote speaker. At 7 pm
	Dr. Karson S. Putt began his seminar, which was titled "Inhibition
	of an erythrocyte tyrosine.  kinase prevents Plasmodium falciparum
	egress and terminates parasitemia". In his role as Managing
	Director, Putt oversees over 110 faculty members and over 600
	students at the Purdue University Center for Drug
	Discovery. During the presentation he explained how inhibition of
	a specific enzyme can arrest malaria. This is a breakthrough
	finding.  According to the World Health Organization, one child
	dies from malaria every minute, and half of the world’s population
	remains at risk of infection.  Because this threat is expected to
	rise as drug resistance continues to eliminate established
	treatment options, the search for novel anti-malarial therapies
	has intensified. There are over 200 million infections of malaria
	every year, which is endemic in Africa, South and Central America,
	and South East Asia.

    The original speaker for this event was Kristina Kesely. However,
    just 9 days before her visit to Kalamazoo she received word that
    human trial studies in Vietnam were approved by the Vietnamese
    Ministry of Health and Purdue IRB. Within less than a week's notice
    Kesely and her team had to prepare for a month-long visit to South
    East Asia to gather data for their novel therapy. This was an
    exciting development but it also meant that someone else needed to
    fill in for her. Organizers were happy to learn that Putt could step
    in on short notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Event visitors had a chance to enjoy hot appetizers and beer from 5
    to 9 pm while listening to the keynote speech and reviewing the
    posters that were given by scientists from Kalamazoo College,
    Michigan State University, Western Michigan University, and
    Zoetis. There were 21 new or "recycled" (from a previous conference)
    posters, including a total of 15 student presenters. This year,
    there were also three cash prizes drawn from poster presenters who
    submitted their abstracts by November 4. The winners were Basil
    Ahmed, Wisam A. Alisawi and Harry Chanzu.
