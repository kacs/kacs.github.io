This summer our Local Section once again participated, for the
twenty-first year, in the American Chemical Society’s Project SEED
outreach activity which gives an opportunity for economically
disadvantaged high school students to apply for, and be selected to,
work with a mentor in a research environment. The KACS is indebted to
**Dr. Donald Schreiber** for being responsible for the placement of
Project SEED students in their positions for the past 19 years.

The pictures below show the two students who spent June 14 to August
10 in the Western Michigan University Chemistry Department
laboratories of **Dr. Ramakrishna Guda** and **Dr.  Sherine Obare**,
and as a Section we appreciate their willingness to serve as mentors.
Unfortunately, they were unavailable at the time of the project
display and presentation of the research to visitors.
