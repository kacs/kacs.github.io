*Thomas C. Werner*

The alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs has tainted athletic
accomplishment since the beginning of sporting
competition. Contemporary examples of this sports “doping” problem
appear almost daily in the news: pro cycling is brought to its knees
by doping allegations, resulting in the loss of sponsorship, the BALCO
case and the Mitchell Report pummel Major League Baseball with
evidence of steroid use and drug testing concerns become a higher
profile issue at the Olympics.

The talk will focus on the methods that chemists use to detect sports
doping with substances such as amphetamine, steroids, human growth
hormone and EPO. Limitations of these methods will be discussed, along
with a listing of some of the enormous challenges facing chemists as
newer doping substances and methods become available. The talk is
based on a course entitled Chemistry and Athletic Performance, which
was developed by the speaker with the aid of Dr. Don Catlin and staff
at the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory and Anti-Doping Research,
