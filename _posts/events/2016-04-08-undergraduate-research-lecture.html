      Dr. Tom Higgins, a 1992 graduate of Kalamazoo College, addressed
      the KACS on <em>How Undergraduate Research can Change Students'
	Lives</em> on Friday 8 April. Dr. Higgins worked to develop an
      undergraduate research program in the community colleges in
      Chicago. Longitudinal studies show that students who participated
      in research persisted in science to a higher degree than similar
      students who did not do research and had a higher rate of
      transferring to four-year institutions. Dr. Higgins is a professor
      at Harold Washington College and is currently a Program Director
      at the National Science Foundation. During his visit to Kalamazoo,
      Tom also had an opportunity to meet with and talk to faculty and
      students from WMU, KVCC, and Kalamazoo College.
