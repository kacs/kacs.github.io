What a pleasant evening we had hosting a gathering of approximately
100 enthusiastic attendees: students, parents, grandparents, high
school teachers, and KACS members, for our Section’s fortieth Awards
presentation to High school students who have excelled in Chemistry
either routinely in the classroom, as recommended by their teachers,
and/or as a result of success on a two-stage chemistry exam
administered by our Section. In the last couple of years we have also
formally recognized past chairs of the Section with “Past-Chair”
pins. Also recognized at this ceremony are KACS members who have been
members of the Society for 50 years, outstanding College Students
nominated by the two 4-year colleges in our Section, an outstanding
high school teacher, and one (or more) Section member(s) or friend(s)
who has consistently given of his/her time and energy for the
successful execution of any of our Section’s activities – it is always
“fun” to see the surprise on the recipient’s face.
