      As of September 2018, there are 124 million enzyme sequences
      deposited in public databases. Is there one to do the chemical
      reaction you want? Katie will discuss the process of discovering
      novel enzyme "needles" in a haystack that grows by 5 million
      every month. Applications related to natural manufacturing of
      flavor and fragrance molecules will be discussed, including the
      semi-serendipitous discovery of a novel route to the pheromone,
      sulcatone.
