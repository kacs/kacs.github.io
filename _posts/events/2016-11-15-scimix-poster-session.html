	KACS hosted its annual poster session titled <em>Sustainable Science
	  &ndash; Recycle a Poster</em> at Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute; in
	downtown Kalamazoo on Nov. 15, 2016. For the 6th year in a row,
	KACS organized this public event, which was made possible through
	a generous grant from Zoetis. As before, there were many research
	posters in addition to a keynote speaker. Over 110 people
	attended this social gathering; 49% of the attendees were ACS
	members.

    Dr. McTier discussed the discovery and development of sarolaner
    (Simparica<sup>&reg;</sup>) in Zoetis' labs here in Kalamazoo in his
    talk <em>Discovery and Development of Simparica<sup>&reg;</sup> &ndash; A Novel
      Companion Animal Isoxazoline Parasiticide</em>. He is Therapeutic
    Area Head for Companion Animal Parasitology and Research Director in
    Global Therapeutics Research, Veterinary Medicine Research and
    Development at Zoetis in Kalamazoo, MI. This drug is a novel
    isoxazoline derivative and has unique structural features important
    for its potency and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.

    Event visitors had a chance to enjoy hot appetizers and beer from 5
    to 9 pm while listening to the keynote speech, mingling and
    reviewing the posters that were given. There were 28 new or
    "recycled" (from a previous conference) posters highlighting
    scientific results from Zoetis, Kalamazoo College and Western
    Michigan University (WMU), among others. Some work was done in
    collaboration with other institutions. There were 15 student
    presenters from WMU; 8 from Kalamazoo College and one student from
    Portage High School. The local section also gave out three $50 cash
    prizes, which were drawn from the pool of poster presenters who
    submitted an abstract early. KACS Treasurer Andre R. Venter
    delivered the prizes to the winners: Lainey R. Barber, Nicole
    L. Burke and Haider Faraj.

    The Kalamazoo Local Section also used this popular event as an
    opportunity to get feedback from all visitors by distributing a
    paper survey. The Executive Committee thanks all the participants
    for filling out the questionnaires, and the data is currently being
    reviewed. Last but not least, the KACS Board is grateful for the
    financial support that Zoetis has provided to help defer the
    expenses associated with this event.
