<h2> Report from the 2014 WMU Chemistry Graduate Student Association
 (CGSA) Picnic</h2>
<p class="author">By Sarut Jianrattanasawat</p>
<p>
 On June 6, the CGSA hosted its 4th annual cookout for local chemists
 at the Oshtemo Township Park. First and foremost, CGSA would like to
 thank KACS for the generous financial support. The event was
 successful. We had more than 40 attendees, including faculty, staff,
 undergraduate and graduate students from WMU, and KACS members from
 around Kalamazoo, as a well as some chemists-to-be. Many
 participated in activities such as tennis and soccer. We are glad to
 see this event gaining popularity as a local tradition.
