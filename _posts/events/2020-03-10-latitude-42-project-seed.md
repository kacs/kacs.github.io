      We are still a little hung over from last year’s celebration of
      the International Year of the Periodic Table (IYPT) but that
      won’t stop us from continuing our partnership with breweries to
      benefit Project SEED, which provides summer research internships
      for disadvantaged high school students. On March 10, we will
      feature a discussion by local master brewer Mike Babb of some
      locally produced beer styles and the brewing methods used to
      prepare them. We will also say a few words (short, we promise)
      about Project SEED and ways that you can help us support and
      grow our local section program. Food and beer samples (for the
      discussion) from the Latitude 42 menu will be provided. There is
      no cost to KACS members (and one guest) to attend but space is
      limited and an accurate headcount is important for our
      preparation. <strong>RSVP</strong> your name and guest's name,
      if applicable, by <strong>March 1</strong>
      to <a href="/people/williams.html">Doug Williams</a>. We even
      have some leftover prizes from the IYPT celebrations to give
      away or raffle off.
