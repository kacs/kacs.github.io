The Dow Building at Kalamazoo College hosted a Science Cafe'
presentation by our own Section's Chair-Elect, Dr. John Englemann, of
Miller Canfield Paddock and Stone, on Wednesday, February 27. An
audience of about 25 learned the importance of patents not only in
terms of protecting one's invention (something New, Useful and
Non-obvious) but also the benefit it can bring to the balance sheet of
a business and of an academic institution; as Dr. Engelmann showed us,
there is levity even in a field such as this by giving several
examples of "silly paents" which have been granted. He used an
invention for which he was the attorney who filed and secured a patent
- a flat easy-to-carry podium. He also answered questions from the
audience, and at least one attendee expressed an interest in pursuing
patent law as a career.
