In collaboration with the Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical
Society, several faculty experts from the Western Michigan University
(WMU) Climate Change Working Group will provide training on global
climate change in a free half-day workshop held at WMU on January
25th.  Experts will work closely with participants to provide an
interdisciplinary introduction and lead hands-on computer-based
exercises on four major aspects of climate change:

1. The Scientific Basis of Climate Change.
2. Effects of Climate Change on Ecosystem and Human Health.
3. Climate Change Mitigation:  The Roles of Personal Behaviors and Alternate Energy Technologies.
4. Social Responses to Climate Change:  Economic and Political Considerations.

This first workshop is being offered primarily to faith community
leaders and other educators. Subsequent workshops reaching out to the
local troops of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America and
educators from the Kalamazoo Public Schools are planned for **February
1st** and **February 22nd** respectively. For all of the workshops,
participation by other community members will be welcomed, space
permitting. Light breakfast and lunch will be provided.
