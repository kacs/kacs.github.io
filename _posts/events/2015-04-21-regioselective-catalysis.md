      The development of several classes of regioselective Ni- and Cu-
      catalyzed processes will be discussed.  Recent efforts from our
      laboratory have focused on regiodivergent couplings and
      hydrometallations of alkenes, alkynes, and allenes.  Strategies
      for effecting regiochemistry reversals in the processes as well as
      the mechanistic understanding of these outcomes will be discussed.
      Additionally, applications of these principles in arene C-­‐H
      functionalizations via alkene and alkyne insertion will be
      described.
