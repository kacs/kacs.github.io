  Food impacts many of the most dire problems facing humanityâ€”health,
  sustainability, global warming, poverty and inequality. Join
  Professor Joseph "Jody" Puglisi, Professor in the Department of
  Structural Biology at Stanford University and Head Scientific
  Advisor to Beyond Meat, for a discussion of the chemistry behind new
  plant-based alternatives to animal meat and how these innovations
  could help address these global challenges.
