  KACS is again sponsoring the annual WMU Chemistry Graduate Student
  Association (CGSA) spring picnic. The purpose of this event is to
  introduce chemistry graduate and undergraduate students to the KACS
  community outside of the university. In previous years, this event
  has been a successful opportunity to gather professors, students,
  and local ACS members. This is a family-friendly event with many
  activities and yummy food!
</p>
<p>Bring the entire family to this fun event.</p>

<h1 id="project-seed">Project SEED Opportunities</h1>
<img src="/images/project-seed/project-seed-logo.jpg" alt="Project Seed Logo" />

<p>
  Project SEED was established by the American Chemical Society (ACS)
  in 1968 to provide economically disadvantaged high school students
  the opportunity to conduct hands-on research for 8 to 10 weeks in
  the summer. Selected students receive a fellowship award and will be
  eligible to apply for a SEED college scholarship.
</p>

<p>
  In the summer of 2015, two students were awarded Project SEED
  opportunities. Jacob Wasylliw worked with Dr. Szymcznya at Western
  Michigan University (WMU) on a project titled “Bioinformatics of
  Tanapox Virus Proteome”.  Kathryn Way worked with Dr. Guda at WMU on
  a project titled "Optical Spectroscopy to Monitor Ligand-DNA Binding
  Interactions".
</p>

<p>
  This year the Kalamazoo ACS (KACS) is looking to fill two Project
  SEED positions. One will be with Dr Szymczyna and one will be with
  Dr. Guda.To qualify the student must have completed his or her
  sophomore year in good academic standing, have taken at least one
  course in chemistry, and be recommended by their chemistry teacher
  or other school official. Students are selected based on their
  qualifications and letters of recommendation. High school chemistry
  teachers should have received a letter detailing the project and
  nominating process. If you have not received the letter or need more
  information please contact Don Schreiber, Project SEED Coordinator
  or Mike Walsh, KACS Education Chair.

    Dr. Tom Higgins, a 1992 graduate of Kalamazoo College, addressed
    the KACS on "How Undergraduate Research can Change Student' Lives"
    on Friday 8 April. Dr. Higgins worked to develop an
    undergraduate research program in the community colleges in
    Chicago. Longitudinal studies show that students who participated
    in research persisted in science to a higher degree than similar
    students who did not do research and had a higher rate of
    transferring to four-year institutions. Dr. Higgins is a professor
    at Harold Washington College and is currently a Program Director
    at the National Science Foundation. During his visit to Kalamazoo,
    Tom also had an opportunity to meet with and talk to faculty and
    students from WMU, KVCC, and Kalamazoo College.

<h1>Report: Chemists Celebrate Earth Day Events</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia M. Hines, Ph.D.</p>

<p>
  Saturday, April 23, 2016<br/>
  Kalamazoo Nature Center (10am - 4pm)<br/>
  Celery Flats (11am - 3pm)<br/>
</p>
<img src="/images/events/cced-2016-banner.png" alt="CCED event banner"
     class="img-default img-responsive" />

<h3>Celery Flats in Portage</h3>
<p>
  Spring arrived on and off in April and the forecast was for a sunny
  day on the 23rd; but the temperature was still in the 60s so our
  first experience at the Portage Green-a-thon was a pretty "cool"
  one. The event was very well organized by the Portage Youth Advisory
  committee and their liaison from the City Clerk's office. It was our
  first attempt at cooperation with them and we were very pleased to
  have made that contact. Lydia Hines, along with the expert help of
  Carl Stachew (well known to many in KACS, and others in the
  education circles, for his passion for science outreach to young
  people), and the enthusiasm of 4 Kalamazoo College Students, Ian
  Bunker, John Bailey, Sarah Glass and Joyce Nguyen saw 6 hours pass
  with never a dull moment as youngsters and their parents stopped
  by our table to make UV-sensitive-bead bracelets and to learn about
  carbon dioxide, its varied sources and uses, and to make chalk, as
  well as to get copies of Celebrating Chemistry to take home to
  continue "doing science experiments". A great experience overall,
  which I hope some of the readers of this newsletter will want to
  enjoy as we celebrate Earth Day in April of 2017!
</p>

<h3>Kalamazoo Nature Center</h3>
<p>
  This was our 6th year of participation with the Kalamazoo Nature
  Center during their Earth Day Celebration; Taylor Grace, Emily
  Hanner, Greg Johnson and Casey Wright from the WMU Chem Club were
  present at the opening of the event in the morning and were busy
  making chromatography flowers with youngsters and their parents who
  came by the KACS table. The steady flow of visitors continued
  through the afternoon when visitors could also avail themselves of
  our Celebrating Chemistry publication for their continued science
  enjoyment at home. K College students Myles Truss, Sangtawun Miller
  and Andrew Kaylor along with KACS chair Brian Eklov held down the
  fort during the afternoon hours.

  Many thanks are due to all who volunteered at this annual event!

<h1>Report: The Science Behind Crafting Beer</h1>
<p class="author">By Andre Venter, Ph.D.</p>

<img src="/images/events/craft-beer-1.jpg"
     alt="Panorama of craft beer event" />

<p>
  On April 12, KACS's topical group <em>The Kalamazoo Area Mass
    Sepectrometry Discussion Group</em> and Thermo Fisher Scientific
    hosted a seminar on mass spectrometry and the science behind
    crafting beer. This event at Bells Brewery Eccentric Café brought
    91 attendees together. The crowd represented a wholesome mix of
    those working in mass spectrometry or in the brewing industry and
    included professionals, students and other interested members of
    the public.  Two presentations were presented providing a mixed
    taste of beer quality control and beer flavor innovation.
</p>
<p>
  The first presentation was delivered by Dr. Barbara Dunn from the
  Department of Genetics at Stanford University and was
  entitled <em>The Systematic Integration of Omics Data to Improve
  Innovation in Beer Crafting</em>. Dr. Dunn described how systems
  biology is used to study, for example, the differences between
  popular yeast strains used in the production of California Ale and
  Hefeweizen beer styles.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Luke Chadwick, Senior Scientist at Bells Brewery, presented on
  how the challenge to make a delicious beer consistently can be
  addressed by picking it apart at the molecular level. Dr. Chadwick
  presented an overview of the instrumentation used in a brewing
  laboratory and on the role of data in the quest for ever-increasing
  beer quality. He dazzled us with numerous rabbit holes of yet to be
  explored challenges faced by those who take a scientific approach to
  crafting quality beer.
</p>
<p>
  Thermo Fisher Scientific demonstrated the use of the
  Gallery<sup>&trade;</sup> Plus Beermaster. This photometric analyzer
  provides automated efficiency in quality control measurements to
  help reduce costs and improve productivity in breweries. For more
