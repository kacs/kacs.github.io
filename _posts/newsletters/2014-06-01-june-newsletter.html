  <div class="comments-content">
    <p class="author">By John H. Engelmann</p>

    <p>
      The fireworks season is here.  Fireworks are very old. They were
      developed in India and China, long before the idea of fireworks
      came to Europe. Fireworks came to Europe somewhat
      later. However, by 1635, a book published in London showed
      fireworks very similar to what we have today.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book even discloses salts used to provide color. Fireworks
      are based upon straight forward chemistry.  The major components
      of fireworks are oxidizers, reducing molecules, and metals which
      provide color. An oxygen-containing molecule provides oxygen to
      oxidize a reducing agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major oxygen containing molecules used on fireworks are
      potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), potassium chlorate
      (KClO<sub>3</sub>), and potassium perchlorate
      (KClO<sub>4</sub>). The major reducing molecules are carbon,
      and sulfur. The metals include magnesium, aluminum and iron.
      Various metal salts are added to provide color. Strontium
      provides red color; barium provides green color, and copper
      provides blue color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black powder, that is, a mixture of potassium nitrate, sulfur,
      and charcoal is the most common composition used in
      fireworks. Aerial displays use black powder as the propellant to
      get the fireworks display into the air. Another common mixture
      used in fireworks is flashcracker powder used to make
      firecrackers which explode with a loud report and a bright
      flash. Flashcracker powder is a mixture of potassium
      perchlorate, aluminum and sulfur. It is used in aerial devices
      to provide explosions accompanied by a bright flash. Colored
      displays include flakes of various metals or metal salts which
      are added to the composition to produces colored stars which
      twinkle as they burn. So look up to the night sky and enjoy
      fireworks.

<h2>KACS Makes Educational Donation</h2>
<p class="author">by John Miller</p>

<p>
  Thanks to a recommendation to the Executive Committee of the KACS,
  we have donated two sets of study guides, one each, to the libraries
  of Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo College. These guides
  were provided as an additional resource to help students prepare for
  the American Chemical Society's General Chemistry, Organic
  Chemistry, and Physical Chemistry subject examinations. (The
  Kalamazoo Valley Community College library declined a similar
  offer.)
</p>

<h2>Webinar Redux</h2>
<p class="author">by Elke Schoffers</p>

<p>
  On May 6, 2014, the Kalamazoo Local Section participated in an "LSAC
  Best Practices Webinar", which was organized by the National ACS
  Committee on Local Section Activities (LSAC). LSAC Chair Martin Rudd
  facilitated the webinar, which included the discussion of three
  local sections’ events – those adaptable to any section size. KACS
  Past-Chair Elke Schoffers was one of three presenters; she explained
  how our Zoetis-sponsored "Sustainable Science-Recycle A Poster"
  activity at Bell's Eccentric Cafe was organized, how it is currently
  executed and clearly communicated its success as a forum for
  bringing together students and professional chemists from industry
  and academia. A transcript and the presentation slides can be viewed
  on the

      graduate and undergraduate students to the KACS community
      outside of the university.  There will be vegetarian and

<h1 id="awards-ceremony">KACS Awards Ceremony</h1>
<p class="author">by Megan Grunert</p>

    <p>
      The 41st KACS Awards presentation was held on Monday, May 12, on
      the Western Michigan University campus with a record-number of
      attendees. Awardees included four individuals celebrating 50
      years of ACS membership, the Outstanding High School Chemistry
      Teacher, Outstanding College Chemistry Student awards, several
      high school student awards, and awards recognizing service to
      the KACS section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The awards for high school students are based on outstanding
      achievement on the Competitive Examination Competition, organized by
      Dr. James Kiddle, or on nominations from teachers at local
      schools. The Outstanding High School Chemistry Teacher is nominated
      by the high school principal.  Dr. Sherine Obare and Dr. Andre
      Venter were instrumental in reviewing nominations and selecting this
      year’s award winner. Both Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo
      College selected an Outstanding College Chemistry Student.

      her many years of participation as presenter at Chemistry Day at the
      Museum, and Doug Williams and Elke Schoffers for their enthusiastic,
      positive, and continuing leadership in the Section.  The section
      would also like to recognize the significant contributions from the
      Education Committee (Megan Grunert, James Kiddle, Sherine Obare, and
      Andre Venter), Lydia Hines, Elke Schoffers, and Robin Lenkart in
      organizing another outstanding awards ceremony. Congratulations to
      all awardees who are recognized below.

<h1>Important News from ACS</h1>
<p class="author">by Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  In the spring of 2014 there was a report of an <strong>accident in a
  New York High School Chemistry class</strong> after a presentation
  of the <strong>Rainbow Demonstration</strong>.  The Committee on
  Chemical Safety of the American Chemical Society responded to that
  incident with a comment in the March 17, 2014 (p. 43) issue of
  C&amp;E News, along with an offer of
  a <a href="http://www.acs.org/safety" title="ACS National Safety webpage">
    website</a> where teachers can find alternative
  demonstrations, suitable for the HS classroom, which can be carried
  out safely. Our Councilor, Lydia Hines, sent this information by
  e-mail to all of our K-12 teachers immediately upon her return from
  the Spring ACS Meeting in Dallas, in March.
</p>
<p>
  Another item which our councilor sent out to our <strong>Section’s HS
  teachers</strong> was an e-mail informing them that in addition to the many
  <a href="http://acs.org/education" title="ACS education resources">
    educational chemistry resources</a> available to teachers, the ACS
    offers opportunity for them to apply for
  <strong>grants up to $1500</strong> for enhancing their students’ educational
  experience. Application and further information may be found at
  <a href="http://www.acs.org/hachgrants" title="ACS HS grants page">
    www.acs.org/hachgrants</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Coming in September:
  <a href="http://www.mmsend50.com/link.cfm?r=861216494&sid=40487463&m=4487669&u=ACS1&j=18823484&s=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/educators/aact.html"
     title="American Association of Chemsitry Teachers homepage">
    The American Association of Chemistry Teachers (AACT)</a>!</strong>
  Serving K–12 teachers of chemistry everywhere, AACT will
  offer specialized chemistry teaching resources, a periodical about
  teaching chemistry in the K–12 classroom, an online community for
  sharing, and more.
</p>
<p>
  For our <strong>unemployed members</strong> the ACS offers links
  to career-assistance tools, benefits and other resources
  at <a href="http://www.acs.org/unemployed"
	title="ACS resources for unemployed chemists">
    www.acs.org/unemployed</a>. Also, our own KACS
