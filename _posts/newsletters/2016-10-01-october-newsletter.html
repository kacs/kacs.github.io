  <p>I love the end of summer here in Kalamazoo. The weather has not
  yet turned, the gardens and orchards are full of good eats, and
  Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum is just around the
  corner! The Chemistry event is a personal favorite of mine. I
  really enjoy the opportunity to share some science with the scores
  of families that come downtown to join us at the Museum for this
  event. So, please mark your calendars: October 8th, noon to 4
  pm. If you have the time, please come volunteer with us - we have
  plenty of ideas for experiments if you are looking for
  inspiration. If you can't volunteer, grab the kids, grandkids, or
  neighbor's kids, and come down to enjoy the demonstrations and
  activities on hand. I hear there may even be a mystery to solve!
  This year is our 30th year co-hosting this event with the
  Kalamazoo Valley Museum. It is a real gem, and I hope to see you
  there.

  <p>
   Also, please mark your calendars for the evening of Thursday,
   February 23rd. We have reserved the Air Zoo Atrium to celebrate
   the Kalamazoo Local Section's 75th Anniversary! Rides will be
   running, we will be hosting a talk about the SR-71 Blackbird,
   and members of ACS governance will be in attendance. This is
   shaping up to be a great celebration, so please plan on joining
   us for the evening. Look for more information in future
   newsletters on time and RSVP details.

    <p>
      It's that time of the year when summer winds down, fall revs us and
      we get all excited about Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley
      Museum! Chemistry Day has kicked off our fall programs every year
      and this is our 30th birthday! Do you all feel as old as I do?  This
      year's theme is forensic chemistry. Let's do our yearly favorites
      and add in some new ones related to the national theme.  Volunteer
      quickly so we can start promoting the event. Invite new chemists to
      the area for this yearly tradition and help us spread the word
      throughout the Southwest Michigan region that <strong>chemistry is
	fun and for all ages!</strong> Thank you all for your expertise,
      your collaboration with the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, and a rich
      history of science education and manufacturing. I'm so thankful for
      all the friendships over the years and the joy of watching our
      visitors explore and learn during this program.
