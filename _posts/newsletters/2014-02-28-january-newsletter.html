      February is a good month for chemistry. Several famous chemists
      were born in February. Dmitri Mendeleev, the inventor of the
      periodic table, was born in February 1834. February 7 is a
      possible date. Josiah Willard Gibbs was born February 11,
      1839. Gibbs free energy is named after him. Friedrich Konrad
      Beilstein was born February 17, 1838. His standard reference
      work on organic chemistry was first published in 1880-83 and has
      been updated ever since. Linus Carl Pauling was born February
      28, 1901. He made great contributions to the theory of molecular
      structure, and bonding. He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in
      1954 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962. The list goes on. So
      next time you think that February is nothing but snow and cold,
      think again. February is a good month for chemists to be born.

<h1 id="food-event">Chemistry and Culture: Food</h1>
<p class="author">By Elke Schoffers with Photos by Roxana Manta-Bielanski</p>
<p>
  As part of its “Chemistry & Culture” series, KACS hosted a free,
  public event that focused on food titled <strong>“Sense-ational
  Molecules in Nutrition”</strong> at Bell’s Eccentric Café on January
  29, 2014, 6-10 PM. It attracted 98 people who were curious to see a
  presentation, enjoy demonstrations and a variety of snacks. Dr. Sara
  Risch of <em>Popz Europe</em> gave the keynote speech connecting
  nutrition and science by commenting on fats and sodium in foods,
  among others.  She also used jelly beans in order for the audience
  to experience the difference between <em>taste</em>
  and <em>flavor</em>. The talk was followed by
  hands-on-activities. Several different tables were set up for
  everybody to visit with and learn more about chemesthesis, natural
  colors, beer foaming action, and emulsions.

  This event would not have been possible without major funding from
  Kalsec, Waters Corporation and the Great Lakes Concentrates Company
  (GLCC). KACS thanks additional supporters who provided food samples
  or gift cards: Victorian Bakery, Harding’s Friendly Markets, Hunan
  Gardens, Bacchus Wine & Spirits, Sawall Health Food, and Family Fare
  Supermarkets.

<h2>Why Chemistry & Culture?</h2>
<p>
  Chemists are not just experts in their field but are also interested
  in art, history, cooking, baking, brewing, gardening and exercise,
  among others. “Elements of Dance” invited all chemists, chemistry
  enthusiasts and the general public to enjoy ballroom dancing. Future
  “Chemistry and Culture” themes will address topics like “Art
  Conservation”, “Forgery”, “Cooking” and “Gardening”, for example.
</p>
<p>
  The goals of the "Chemistry and Culture" series are...
  <ul>
    <li>
      To offer a social networking opportunity for members of the
      Kalamazoo Local Section of the American Chemical Society (KACS)
      and the public
    </li>
    <li>
      To educate the general public about the goals and activities of
      KACS
    </li>
    <li>
      To highlight the connections between "chemistry" and "culture"
    </li>
    <li>
      To encourage student participation
    </li>
    <li>
      To instill an appreciation for how chemistry contributes to the
      world in many ways
    </li>
    <li>
      To forge ties with the local community
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Love Potion #9: The Chemistry of Scent & Fragrance</h2>
<p class="author">By Amanda Bolles</p>
<p>A Younger Chemists Committee (YCC) webinar</p>
<p>
  Three days before Valentine’s Day, twenty-three students from
  chemistry clubs at Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University
  came together to participate in a webinar titled <em>Love Potion #9:
  The Chemistry of Scent & Fragrance</em>. Participants learned about
  the history of perfume, the perfumer’s palette, the basics of odor
  analysis, how to use perfumes in products, careers in fragrance
  chemistry and much more. The webinar also included a hands-on
  demonstration, which allowed the students to test their nose for
  fragrance, and a Q&A session with the experts.
</p>

<h2>Call for Volunteers</h2>
<p class="author">By Maren Zanotti</p>
<p>
  This year the ACS is celebrating its eleventh annual Chemists
  Celebrate Earth Day (CCED), an event that is aimed at showing
  chemists’ involvement in preserving the planet we call home. Every
  year the ACS chooses a unifying theme for CCED celebrations, this
  year’s CCED theme is “The Wonders of Water.”
</p>
<p>
  As we have in the past, the KACS will be celebrating CCED by
  participating in the
  <a href="www.naturecenter.org" title="Kalamazoo Nature Center website">
    Kalamazoo Nature Center</a>’s Earth Day celebration on Saturday,
  April 26, 2014 from 10 am to 5 pm. We will be hosting an
  informational table that will offer hands-on water related chemistry
  demonstrations and educational resources for the attendees.
</p>
<p>
  As March and April approach there will be more details to come about
  the Earth Day events we have planned. If you have any suggestions
  for other Earth Day events or ideas for activities that could be
  implemented in CCED please
  <a href="mailto:maren.c.zanotti@wmich.edu">

<h2>Trip Report Summary: ACS Leadership Training</h2>
<p class="author">By Brian Eklov</p>
<p>
  Every year the national ACS holds a Leadership Institute in Dallas
  on the last weekend in January. Each local section is asked to send
  one executive committee member for training, and I represented the
  KACS at this year’s meeting.  It was a jam-packed schedule, and we
  were busy!  The topics of discussion covered everything imaginable,
  from funding and planning activities, communications, and working
  with the national office.  We even discussed how to file the local
  section’s taxes.  Needless to say, I learned a lot, met a good
  number of the national ACS staff, and came back with some good ideas
  for the future.  I’m looking forward to applying what I learned over
  the next year as Chair-Elect of the KACS.

<h2>
  What can ACS do to increase the Quality of Science Education in Grades 7-12?
</h2>

<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>
<p>
  In the last few years, at Council Meeting at the National ACS
  meetings, councilors have been given opportunity to comment on a
  specific issue of particular interest and concern to the Society
  president; at the Dallas council meeting on March 19 our current
  president, Thomas Barton (U of Iowa emeritus), who has a great
  concern about K-12 education in the US, has offered opportunity for
  councilors to respond to the question “What can ACS do to increase
  the quality of Science Education in Grades 7-12?”. During the time
  allotted I would be happy to present suggestions, which you may want
  to share with me.  [I plan to leave for the meeting on March 16, so
  if you care to reach me please do so before then, either at
  269-375-7349 or at
  <a href="mailto:lemhwgh@gmail.com" title="E-mail Lydia">
    lemhwgh@gmail.com</a>].
  The extensive array of curricular and extra-curricular educational
  offerings for K-16 students, teachers (and members) may be found at
  <a href="www.acs.org/education" title="ACS eduation resources">
    www.acs.org</a>,
  and many of these are free to the parties for whom they are
  intended; I have brought the majority of them to our Section’s
  teachers’ attention by means of e-mail or personal contact.

<h2>WMU Climate Change Program</h2>
<p class="author">By John Miller</p>
<p>
  The KACS has partnered with the Western Michigan University Climate
  Change working group (http://www.wmuclimatechange.info/) to provide
  a series of workshops on climate change, focusing on the ACS Climate
  Change Toolkit
  (http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience.html). The target
  audiences are non-scientists who are in a position to pass along the
  information to their constituent audiences. This program was funded
  by a mini-grant from National ACS, and a small grant from WMU.
</p>
<p>
  On the very snowy morning of Saturday 19 January, eight members of
  local faith communities, primarily education and outreach
  coordinators, braved the weather for this four-hour workshop on the
  WMU campus. (Four others were registered, but kept away by the
  weather.) On a more clement Saturday 22 February, thirteen teachers
  and educators attended a workshop at KRESA, where they were able to
  earn CEU or SCECH credits.
</p>
<p>
  At both workshops, which included both presentations and hands-on
  activities, five WMU faculty members led the program: Dr. David
  Karowe (Biological Sciences), Dr. Steven Bertman (Chemistry),
  Dr. John B. Miller (Chemistry), Dr. Denise Keele (Environmental
  Sciences) and Dr. Terrell Hodge (Mathematics). The participants
  left with a flash memory drive loaded with copies of the
  presentations and lots of links to useful and fun activities to help
  them spread the scientific consensus on the causes, effects, and
  possible solutions to climate change resulting from human
  activities.
</p>
<p>
  At least one more workshop is planned, with Boy Scout and Girl Scout leaders the intended audience.
