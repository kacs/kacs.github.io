<h1 id="chair-comments">Chemistry of Baseball</h1>
<div class="chair-comments">
 <div class="comments-content">
  <p class="author">By John H. Engelmann</p>

  <p>
   The baseball season is here. Baseball is all about striking
   out, flying out, base hits, runs batted in, and of course home
   runs. What makes baseball possible? It is leather and wood. The
   bat is wood and it receives a varnish treatment before use. The
   player's gloves are leather. The baseball itself is covered in
   leather.
  </p>
  <p>
   We take leather for granted, but where does it come from?
   Leather starts out as an animal hide. In baseball, the animal is
   often a cow or a steer. However, kangaroo hide is also used. The
   fresh animal hide is dried in salt to preserve it before it can
   be tanned. The tanning process begins by treating the animal
   skin with CaCO<sub>3</sub> or NaOH, and scraping to remove the
   hair and any fat. The skin is soaked in water to remove the
   basic reagents. Bacterial growth during the soaking period is
   prevented by biocides such as dithiocarbamates. Fungicides,
   such as TCMBT, that is, <i>2-(Thiocyanomethylthio)
   benzothiazole</i>, are used to protect wet hides from mold
   growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tanning can be performed by either vegetable or mineral
   methods. Vegetable tanning involves treating the hide with
   tannin. Tannin is a bitter plant polyphenolic compound that
   binds to and precipitates proteins. Mineral tanning involves
   treating the hide with chromium III salts. Either way the
   product is leather. Without chemistry we would have no
   leather. Without leather we would have no baseball. Without
   baseball where would America be?

<h2>Resources for Teachers</h2>
<p>
 If you have children or grandchildren, let their teachers know about
 the following resources.</p>
<h3>
 Coming in September,
 <a href="http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/educators/aact.html"
   title="AACT Homepage">The
  American Association of Chemistry Teachers</a> (AACT)!</h3>
<p>
 Serving K–12 teachers of chemistry, AACT will offer specialized
 chemistry teaching resources, a periodical about teaching chemistry
 in the K–12 classroom, an online community for sharing, and more.
</p>

<h3>Career Videos for Youth</h3>
<p>
 As part of this year's <em>Chemists Celebrate Earth Day</em> effort,
 ACS produced
 <a href="http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/cced/video-downloads.html"
   title="Downloadable chemistry videos"><strong>three downloadable
   videos</strong></a> that are a great, age-appropriate resource
   for showing an elementary/middle school audience what chemists
   and chemical engineers do. Teachers can use these videos in a
   career-day program or for classroom use. The three chemists
   interviewed provide insight on what they do in their everyday
   jobs. Visit the
 <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/cced/video-downloads.html"

<h2 id="ncw-announcement">Call for Volunteers: National Chemistry Week</h2>
<p>
 First call for volunteers for our 2015 National Chemistry Week (NCW)
 outreach event at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum. We count on you to
 volunteer your time and engaging disposition for its success again
 this year!
</p>

<div class="row">
 <div class="col-sm-9">
  <p>
   National Chemistry Week will be upon us before we know it; the
   week itself is October 19-25 but <strong>our annual outreach
   event</strong> at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum will be
   on <strong>Saturday 11 October</strong> from noon to 4 p.m. This
   year's theme is <em>The Sweet Side of Chemistry &ndash;
   Candy</em> and our hard-working collaborator at the Museum,
   Annette Hoppenworth, is looking forward to our participation and
   successful execution of this immensely popular program once
   again. Parents, grandparents, teachers, scout leaders and
   children are always rewarded with fun hands-on activities, and
   with written materials which they may take to their homes and
   their schools for encouragement in their science learning – we
   have all heard of STEM education; this informal science learning
   experience is a big part of it at an age when children
   are <strong>scientists in the making</strong> &ndash;
   inquisitive and truly curious. To volunteer for the event please
   contact <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia E. M. Hines</a>. If
   you are at a loss for an activity, she has a list she can send
   you, and she can train you in an activity of your choice.

 <div class="col-md-8">
  <h2>Who Pays for Safety Failures in the Chemistry Laboratory?</h2>
  <p>
   Plan to attend the next KACS Local Section Meeting on the
   ever-current topic of safety at 6:00 p.m. on
   <strong>Tuesday 23 September</strong> 2014 in the <strong>Dow
	Science Building Lecture Hall at Kalamazoo College</strong>
   We have scheduled <strong>Dr. Kenneth Fivizzani</strong>, Nalco
   Company (retired) and Chair, ACS Division of Chemical Health &amp;
   Safety as our speaker.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chemistry community and the general public have become more
   aware of incidents in chemical laboratories. Some serious
   accidents in both academic and industrial laboratories have had
   widespread repercussions to the organizations in which these
   accidents occur. If a regulatory agency, such as OSHA or EPA,
   cites a violation of a law or regulation, fines and remediation
   costs can be significant. Legal expenses for responses, trials,
   and appeals can grow quickly. But there are broader costs to the
   reputations of principal investigators, departments,
   institutions, and even for the science of chemistry. If students
   do not feel safe in undergraduate and research laboratories,
   they will be less likely to choose a career in science. If the
   general public does not trust chemical professionals to work
   safely in laboratories, there could be calls for more regulation
   of lab activity, and funding for chemical research might be
   reduced. There are many good reasons for organizations to
   establish strong safety cultures and ensure that laboratory
   personnel are well trained in lab safety procedures and
   policies.

<p>There will be time at the end for questions.</p>
<p>
  Dr. Fivizzani will meet with <strong>graduate and undergraduate
    students</strong> before his lecture for a <strong>roundtable
    discussion</strong> concerning the large variety of
    non-traditional careers available to students who earn degrees in
    chemistry. <strong>Please contact
    <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia Hines</a> if you are interested
    in participating</strong>. For additional career-related

<h1 id="chemluminary">ChemLuminary Awards</h1>

<h2>Good news, everyone!</h2>
<p>
 Based on our KACS 2013 Annual Report submission, <strong>our section
 has been nominated as a finalist for the ChemLuminary Awards</strong> in
 3 categories:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Outstanding Local Section Industry Event (Recycle-a-poster event)</li>
 <li>Outstanding Performance by a Local Section (Medium Size)</li>
 <li>
  Best New Public Relations Program of a Local Section (Elements of Dance)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 If you will be at the <strong>ACS Meeting in San Francisco</strong>,
 plan to attend the <strong>ChemLuminary Awards Party</strong> on
 Tuesday evening (12 August) at the Palace Hotel from 8 pm to
 midnight to find out whether or not our Section was selected as a
 winner in any or all of those categories. Here is the schedule:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  8:00 - 8:45 pm: you may look at all the finalists' posters and enjoy
  hors d’oeuvres.</li>
 <li>
   8:45 pm: the doors open to the awards ceremony (which lasts about
   one hour)</li>
 <li>10 pm to midnight: the floor opens to those who want to
 celebrate by dancing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Here is what the Local Sections Activities Committee (LSAC) had to
  say about us:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Kalamazoo Local Section's website states: &ldquo;We are a dynamic
    and visionary organization committed to improving people's lives
    in our community through the transforming power of chemistry. We
    strive to advance the broader chemistry enterprise and its
    practitioners for the benefit of Kalamazoo, Allegan and Van Buren
    counties&rdquo;. That vision and mission are being fulfilled and your
    Section continues to impress me with the scope and quality of your
    many activities. Several significant anniversaries were
    celebrated in 2013, including the <em>Awards Ceremony</em> (40 years),
    <em>High School Chemistry Symposium</em> (40 years), <em>Chemistry
      Day at the Museum</em> (as part of NCW, 27 times over 26
    years), <em>Project SEED</em> (23 years), and <em>Chemists
      Celebrate Earth Day</em> (10 years)! What a splendid record of
    continuous effort and yet these activities and events continue
    to grow and improve. <em>Chemistry Day at the Museum</em>
    featured nearly 30 hands-on activities or displays and reached
    over 700 visitors this year with 87 volunteers, including new
    student helpers. The innovative Chemistry &amp; Culture event,
    Elements of Dance, was held again this year and attracted more
    than 200 participants. Inviting the Mayor of Kalamazoo to be the
    Celebrity MC certainly did increase the Section's visibility! A
    Science Caf&eacute; Mini-Grant resulted in <em>Horticultural
      Chemistry &ndash; Color in Flowers</em> event. The innovative
    <em>Recycle a Poster</em> event is one that would fit well into
    many Local Sections seeking to increase industry involvement. The
    stated plan of the ACS Climate Science Grant is to integrate the
    ACS Climate Science Toolkit into its educational outreach activity
    involving education directors or mission leaders in faith-based
    congregations with middle and high school science teachers, and
    with Scout leaders. In partnership with the WMU Climate Science
    Study Group, this ambitious and innovative plan is slated for
    implementation in 2014. It will provide an interesting model for
    other Sections to consider. Many more examples of the Kalamazoo
    Section’s activities could be cited, but it is clear that the
    Kalamazoo Section sets and achieves a high standard of
    activity. KACS goals are also well coordinated with the goals of
    the ACS Strategic Plan
    (www.acs.org/strategicplan). Congratulations on all of your
    high-impact events that both serve your members and involve your
    local community.

<h1>Recent Event Reports</h1>

<h2>DowBQ Report</h2>
<p class="author">By Amanda Bolles</p>
<p>
  On May 29th, 2014, the Kalamazoo College Chemistry Club held their
  annual DowBQ, where students and faculty socialize while eating some
  great food and playing yard games. The DowBQ gets its name from the
  fact that both Chemistry and Biology majors are housed in the Dow
  Science Building. All chemistry and biology students, as well as
  faculty, were invited to the barbecue; it is a great time for
  underclassmen to ask seniors and faculty for advice on internships,
  completing the Senior Individualized Project (SIP), and applying to
  medical school or graduate school. Over 70 students attended the
  event and took the time to celebrate being part of the scientific
  community at Kalamazoo College.

<h2> Report from the 2014 WMU Chemistry Graduate Student Association
 (CGSA) Picnic</h2>
<p class="author">By Sarut Jianrattanasawat</p>
<p>
 On June 6, the CGSA hosted its 4th annual cookout for local chemists
 at the Oshtemo Township Park. First and foremost, CGSA would like to
 thank KACS for the generous financial support. The event was
 successful. We had more than 40 attendees, including faculty, staff,
 undergraduate and graduate students from WMU, and KACS members from
 around Kalamazoo, as a well as some chemists-to-be. Many
 participated in activities such as tennis and soccer. We are glad to
 see this event gaining popularity as a local tradition.
