<h1 id="national-meeting">American Chemical Society Will Meet
Completely Virtually</h1>

<p>
  The American Chemical Society (ACS) announced that it <strong>will
    hold the ACS Fall 2020 National Meeting &amp; Expo completely
    virtually</strong>. The meeting will now be held Aug. 17-20, 2020,
    on the World Wide Web.
</p>
<p>
  Originally scheduled to be held in San Francisco, the physical
  footprint of the meeting was terminated based on established
  COVID-19 reopening plans of the State of California and the City of
  San Francisco, as well as direct inputs from San Francisco city and
  public health officials. The decision, approved by the ACS Board of
  Directors, is in keeping with the Society's core value of safety by
  ensuring the safety of its members, staff and the citizens of San
  Francisco.
</p>
<p>
  Details and other information regarding the Fall National Meeting
  may be accessed at the <a href="https://www.acs.org/meetings"
  title="ACS meetings page">ACS meetings page</a> where there is an FAQ
  page, information regarding the exposition, the technical sessions,
  registration, etc. as well as a way to receive regular updates
  regarding the meeting as its start approaches.
</p>
<p>
  The American Chemical Society (ACS) is a nonprofit organization
  chartered by the U.S. Congress.  ACS' mission is to advance the
  broader chemistry enterprise and its practitioners for the benefit
  of Earth and its people. The Society is a global leader in providing

<h1 id="KACS-awards">2020 Kalamazoo ACS Awardees</h1>

<p>
  Though our 2020 Annual Competitive Examination for High School
  Students was canceled and our in-person annual Awards Gathering was
  not held due to our current pandemic circumstance limitations, the
  KACS delivered award certificates to three long-term members of our
  Society; we also sent award certificates and other tokens of
  commendation, or cheques, to one High School chemistry teacher and
  to high school chemistry students and college graduates whose
  teachers selected them as outstanding.

<h2>Free-to-Read Virtual Issue on Teaching Chemistry Online</h2>

<p>
  To support the dedicated educators who are working so hard and
  diligently to keep their students' chemistry education moving
  forward despite the pandemic, ACS Publications and the ACS Division
  of Chemical Education have compiled
  a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/page/jceda8/vi/teaching-chemistry-online"
  title="ACS teaching resources">collection of distance-teaching
  resources</a>, including free-to-read articles from the <em>Journal
  of Chemical Education</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Over the past several years, articles about learning chemistry at a
  distance and teaching chemistry online have appeared occasionally in
  the <em>Journal of Chemical Education</em>. This
  <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/page/jceda8/vi/teaching-chemistry-online"
     title="ACS teaching resources">virtual issue</a>
  includes many of these articles, along with a few additional
  resources, to provide guidance to chemistry instructors who are now
  finding themselves learning a new, less-than-ideal instructional
  format on the job, with new challenges arising on a regular basis.

<h2>Project SEED Goes Virtual for Summer 2020</h2>

<p>
  ACS Project SEED provides summer research experiences for
  economically disadvantaged high school students to experience what
  it's like to be a chemist. Many of you have contributed time and
  money to support this program, which has operated nationally since
  1968 and locally since 1993. Thank you!
</p>
<p>
  Normally, at this time of year we would be matching our student
  interns with their project mentors.  This summer we had projects
  ready and waiting at Kalamazoo College and Kalsec. Unfortunately,
  the coronavirus pandemic has required ACS to cancel all
  mentor-student internships. In its place, the ACS Project SEED staff
  and committee members have rallied to prepare Virtual Summer Camp
  2020. This four-week program will take in place in July and organize
  students in online groups of 6-10 for instruction and exercises in
  basic lab safety, topics in chemistry research, presentation of
  scientific concepts and college/career readiness (resume writing,
  professional etiquette, etc.). Students will be expected to devote
  10-15 h per week for structured activities. The deadline for student
  applications passed on May 15 and selections will be announced in
  early June. There was at least one confirmed student application
  from our local section. Watch for more news later this summer about
  the successes and learnings from this creative and exciting
  offering. More details are
