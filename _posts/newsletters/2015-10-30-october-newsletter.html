    <p>
      As I was driving in to the
      Kalamazoo Valley Museum to
      set-up for our annual Chemistry
      Day event, it struck me that we
      had the perfect day for this
      year's theme: Chemistry Colors
      Our World.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trees lining the streets sure were putting on a show,
      and the deep green of the chlorophylls, the yellows of
      the carotenes, and the reds and purples of the
      anthocyanins, all against a deep blue sky - it was
      striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big thank you to all of those who chose to spend a
      Saturday afternoon sharing some chemistry with the
      community. As you can read below, we had a great
      turn out, a great response from the attendees, and a
      great time sharing some fun experiments with some
      very eager young minds. I am already looking forward
      to our 30<sup>th</sup> annual Chemistry Day next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking forward, mark the evening of November 10th
      on your calendars. This is when we will gather at Bells
      for our annual SciMix gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dust off an old poster, bring a new one, or just bring
      yourself. I'm looking forward to seeing what everyone has been
      up to over the last year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have two reminders for you:
      <dl>
	<dt>ACS Elections</dt>
	<dd>
	  ACS elections are going on now, both for KACS and
	  national. Please take a moment and add your voice to our
	  choices in governance
	</dd>
	<dt>KACS Volunteers</dt>
	<dd>
	  The KACS is still looking for volunteers. We are actively
	  looking for a Communications Chair, and we have an open
	  position on the executive committee. If you have any
	  interest in either, please let us know. Time commitments are
	  small, but the impact on our programs is not.

<h1>National ACS intensifies outreach to Industrial Chemists</h1>
<p class="author">
  Excerpted from the Fall Councilor Bulletin sent by ACS
</p>
<p>
  Early in 2015, the Committee on Corporation Associates (CA)
  developed a strategic plan for the next two years to address the
  needs of industry scientists and the companies that employ them. The
  CA mission is to influence ACS programs, products and services to
  meet the needs of chemistry-based enterprises, while providing a
  business and corporate voice to the ACS membership and Board of
  Directors. Our aspiration is that these changes will catalyze
  innovation through a thriving partnership between industry and
  ACS. One of the CA focus items is to better communicate challenges
  facing chemistry-based companies. CA will analyze and share data
  collected on companies and their employees, identify unmet needs,
  and communicate findings to governance units throughout the
  Society. In addition to these drivers, CA committed to contribute to
  Society efforts in public policy, and to provide strategic funding
  to programs throughout the Society to aid industry members.
</p>
<p>
  During the CA meeting in the Spring of 2015, the outcomes of recent studies and surveys of industry
  members were discussed. The items most important to industry members were topics that are
  relevant to their current job, topics and training that provide members with new information and
  increased productivity, networking/collaboration, and ways of improving company processes. The
  survey also indicated that industry attendance at national meetings is low because industry members
  are unable to find what they need to take back to their companies and show that they connected to
  make business decisions.
</p>
<p>
  To address these concerns, we are working with ACS staff to improve
  services to industry members.  Examples of these improvements
  include the creation of a new website for industry at
  www.acs.org/industry. The latest version, which was rolled out in
  the summer of 2015, has sections devoted to networking, innovation,
  research reports, professional training, meetings & conferences,
  webinars, and a directory of service providers & consultants.
</p>
<p>
  Staff was also asked to retune the Industry Insights newsletter
  (example issue: 13 May 2015), and to create an Industry Voices blog
  to meet industry member needs for timely information and stories
  related to life in industry. The newsletter now has over 33,000
  subscribers and readership of the blog is growing steadily. An
  online registration form was created for the newsletter to
  facilitate subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
  In the Fall of 2015 at the Boston meeting CA cosponsored an
  industry-related ACS Presidential Symposium entitled <em>Transforming
    University-Industry Partnerships for an Innovative Future</em>. This
  symposium highlighted the role of better university-industry
  partnerships in driving more innovation which will lead to a more
  competitive nation. Speakers challenged the existing framework for
  partnerships with perspectives on how to better enable, execute, and
  energize collaboration. In addition, the impact on individuals was
  explored, including graduate student perspectives on benefits and
  challenges from industrial collaborations.
</p>
<p>
  Stay tuned as we continue to improve ACS for industry!

      Ir-catalyzed C&ndash;H borylations can eliminate the need for halogens,
      alkyllithiums, and/or cryogenic conditions for the syntheses of
      cross-coupling partners. Moreover, their chemeoselectivity and atom
      economy allows for the combination of catalytic borylations with
      subsequent chemical events. Given the prominent role cross-
      couplings play in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
      and organic electronic materials, industry has shown considerable
      interest in such C&ndash;H activation processes. Indeed, the
      Pharmaceutical Roundtable of the American Chemical Society's Green
      Chemistry Institute deemed cross-couplings that avoid haloaromatics
      as one of their top aspirational reactions.

<h1 id="ncw">2015 Chemistry Day</h1>
<h2>KACS 29<sup>th</sup> National Cehmistry Week Outreach</h2>
<p class="author">By
  <a href="/people/hines.html">
    Lydia E.M. Hines</a>
</p>
<p>
  Once again, cold weather arrived early in Kalamazoo, Michigan, just
  in time for our much-anticipated National Chemistry Week (NCW)
  hands-on-chemistry outreach to our community! It was a good
  opportunity to stay indoors, so 1000 patrons (children and families)
  visited our chemistry-themed activities in our area’s two-storey
  museum and the Volcano demonstration outside the building, on
  Saturday, October 17, 2015, from noon to 4 pm. Our long-time
  partner, the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, diligently added extensive
  publicity in the print media (5 venues), in 2 TV shows, and on
  several FM and AM radio programs to our online flyers sent to
  schools, libraries and other targeted audience groups.
</p>
<p>
  Among our visitors were one family from Grand Rapids who heard the
  ad on TV :), two large Girl Scout groups and several area teachers
  who eagerly took ACS's American Association of Chemistry Teachers
  (AACT) information, as well as home-schooling families, who were
  delighted with all the age-appropriate information we had available
  for them - Celebrating Chemistry and ChemMatters.
</p>
<p>
  As in other years, enthusiasm among both KACS members and other volunteers continued to build
  as the event neared, and our accommodating colleague at the Museum, Mrs. Annette Hoppenworth,
expertly fit in 80 volunteers presenting 25 activities. “Worker bees” for the duration of the event
included many High School students, undergraduates and graduate students, local industry
representatives, college and university faculty and others who just enjoy seeing the excitement
  registered on visitors’ faces each year.
</p>
<p>
  Sincere appreciation is extended to each one who made this event another HUGE success.
</p>
<p>
  Note: What follows is a story about how our Section's programs work
  hand in hand to continue giving: Readers should be aware of our
  Local section's 33-year history of administering a Competitive Exam
  followed by an Awards Program; well, as I was looking over the names
  of the High School young people who, over the past several years,
  have been given awards by our Section for their exemplary
  performance on our Competitive Examination, I came across four names
  that sounded very familiar because they appeared on the list of
  volunteers at our 2015 Chemistry Day &ndash; one was that of Sarah Glass,
  a 2013 awardee, a graduate of Wayland (MI) High School, and the
  other 3 were Hannah McQueen, Josiah Turpin, and Chris Vennard, 2015
  awardees. Sarah is now studying chemistry at Kalamazoo College and
  is one of the leaders of the Chemistry club on that campus; as such
  she has been instrumental in organizing and enlisting a group of her
  fellow students to present activities at our Chemistry Day at the
  Museum both this year and last. The other three are 2015 awardees
  and continue as students at Gull Lake High School. It is exciting to
  see these young people enthusiastically participating in an activity
  that shares the importance and fun of chemistry with the younger
  generation.
