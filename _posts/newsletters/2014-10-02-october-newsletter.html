    <p>
      Spring has come, given way to summer, and now the fall season is
      upon us. Leaves which turned so happily green, due to
      chlorophyll, are now turning brown or red. It is easy to
      understand why leaves turn green in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chlorophyll, which the leaves use to convert carbon dioxide
      and water into carbohydrates is bright green which accounts for
      the green color of leaves. In the fall, when chlorophyll is no
      longer being produced the leaves lose their green color and the
      background brown or red color shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the growing season chlorophyll is consumed in the
      production of carbohydrates and accordingly, chlorophyll is
      produced continuously so that leaves remain green and continue
      to produce carbohydrates.  In the fall, the veins that carry
      fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off by a
      layer of cells which form at the base of the leaf. As this layer
      becomes thicker, the plant provides less water and minerals to
      the leaf and chlorophyll production decreases and eventually
      stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chlorophyll and the light harvesting complex of the leaf is
      degraded into colorless products including amino acids. In
      annual plants the amino acids are either further degrades or
      enter the soil. In perennial plants, including trees, the amino
      acids are stored in the roots, branches, stems, and trunk and
      are recycled in the spring. The brown and red colors of fall
      leaves does not come from the degradation products of
      chlorophyll, but rather from the yellow xanthophylls and orange
      β-carotene which are present throughout the year, but are
      concealed by the green chlorophyll. In addition the leaf may
      synthesize red anthocyanins.

<p>
  The Gull Lake Community Schools Foundation will kick off its 2014-15
  Spark Series <em>Year of Science</em> with a <strong>Science &
  Engineering Festival</strong> on Nov 7-8 at Gull Lake High School
  (7753 N. 34th St., Richland, MI). The Nov 7 program is for 3000 area
  <strong>middle school students</strong> but events on Saturday, Nov
  8 are <strong>open to the public</strong> from 9 am – 4 pm, free of
  charge. <a href="http://mindtrekkers.mtu.edu/"

<h2 id="ec-positions">Join the Executive Committee of your Kalamazoo Local Section</h2>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  We have an immediate need for candidates for Kalamazoo
  Section <strong>Chair-Elect</strong> and <strong>Treasurer</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  There is also an urgent need for a <strong>Chair for the KACS
  Education Committee</strong>, a very important role in our Local
  Section organization, as Education is a highly valued outreach for
  us.
</p>
<p>
  Descriptions of the responsibilities for these roles can be found on

<h2>Art Science Caf&eacute;</h2>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      Plan now to attend our Art Science Caf&eacute; on Mole Day, Thursday 23
      October 2014 at 6:02 pm. We will meet at the Richmond Center on
      the WMU campus on the 2nd floor; there will be refreshments in the
      lobby.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our speaker will be <strong>Mr. James Engelmann</strong>, an artist,
      teacher and designer. He works as an exhibition designer at the
      Cleveland Museum of Art and teaches Design Principles at Kent State
      University; he is a son of our current KACS chair and creator of the
      unique pictures of our Section chair for his column in our
      newsletters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The title of his presentation is <em>Art Changes</em>. Jim explains:
      <blockquote>
	We live in an age of visual abundance where the tools of art
	production and distribution are remarkably accessible. Brilliantly
	colorful and durable imagery, which would have been printmaking
	feats in the past, are now sent as throw away mailers to our
	homes. Art innovation, however, is not unique to our
	time. Material and technical innovations are as old as art itself
	and they have consistently changed the way images are produced,
	the nature of those images, and the art experience. In this
	lecture I will examine some of these developments from the past -
	from techniques for synthesizing pigments to the development of
	optics. These innovations and many others have changed what we
	expect art to be and have gradually made possible the pictorial
	mania of today.

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2>Lab Safety Talk Report</h2>
<p class="author">By Brian Eklov</p>
<p>
  Ken Fivizzani, the retired Manager of Chemical Safety Programs at
  Ondeo Nalco and chair of the ACS Committee on Chemical Safety gave a
  talk titled, <em>Who Pays for Safety Failures in the Chemistry
  Laboratory?</em> on 23 Sept at Kalamazoo College. Twenty three members
  of the section (From K College, WMU, and a variety of industrial
  groups) attended Dr. Fivizzani’s talk, which highlighted a number of
  recent cases where safety issues were brought to the attention of
  the broader community and the public. A discussion of the
  wide-raging ramifications followed, and continued into the questions
  after the talk. It is clear that issues of chemical safety have a
  broad impact - from those who suffer injures or lose work, to
  institutions that lose stature, and perhaps even a loss of future
  funding for research and chemical education.
