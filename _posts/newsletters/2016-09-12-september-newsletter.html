      We are entering a busy stretch for KACS.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it may seem a ways off, planning is well underway for
      National Chemistry Week held on October 8th. This is our 30th
      Annual Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, and it just
      may be the crown jewel of the KACS calendar!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for volunteers to run demonstrations and
      activities, and I would like to encourage you all to come
      out and help share some of your enthusiasm for science
      with our attendees. Last year we had over 1000
      attendees participate in over 25 activities, and it was a
      blast!
    </p>
    <p>
      Planning is also underway for our annual SciMix
      gathering later in the year. Stay tuned for details.

  Come join us for our 2016 National Chemistry Week (NCW) celebration,
  our 30th such outreach event at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum! Our
  much-anticipated annual outreach event at the Kalamazoo Valley
  Museum will be on Saturday October 8 from noon to 4 p.m. This year's
  theme is <em>Solving Mysteries through Chemistry</em> with a focus on the
  chemistry of fibers and forensics.
</p>
<p>
  Our hard-working collaborator at the Museum, Annette Hoppenworth, is
  once again looking forward to our participation and successful
  execution of this immensely popular program. Parents, grandparents,
  teachers, scout leaders and children are always rewarded with fun
  hands-on activities, and with safety-tested written materials which
  they may take to their homes and their schools for encouragement in
  their science learning – we have all heard of STEM education; this
  informal science learning experience is a big part of it, at an age
  when children are scientists in the making – inquisitive and truly
  curious.</p>
<p>We have a need for volunteers of various skills and ages! Don’t
  worry, if you are at loss for an activity, we have pre-planned
  forensics science activities and lists of other activities! We can
  also train you in an activity of your choosing. <strong>With your
  help, we are going to make this a fantastic gift to our
    community!</strong>

<h2>Caffeine Camp 2016</h2>

<p>
  Earlier this year the WMU Stryker School of Medicine secured grants
  from the Gilmore, Dalton, and Upjohn Foundations to support a
  program for 10th grade Kalamazoo public school high school students
  for <em>Saturday Science Academies</em> and <em>Summer Enrichment
  Programs</em>. One goal of the program is to increase the number of
  under-represented students entering the pipeline for careers in
  science and medicine. The Program Director is Dr. Cheryl Dickson
  (Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Associate Dean for Health
  Equity and Community Affairs at WMed). The Saturday Science
  Academies occur at the WMed campus and most of the <em>Summer
  Enrichment Programs</em> do as well. In addition, a week-long summer
  science experience is part of the program in collaboration with
  Kalamazoo College.
</p>
<p>
  In summer 2016, the science experience program was held at Kalamazoo
  College and directed by Dr. Laura Lowe Furge (Professor of Chemistry
  and Associate Provost at Kalamazoo College). The program was held
  July 26-30 at the Dow science building at the College. Since
  Dr. Furge is a biochemist with interests in pharmaceuticals and drug
  metabolism, the week centered on learning about proteins, enzymes,
  cytochrome P450 enzymes, and drug metabolism.
</p>
<p>
  Largely hands-on, the week’s activities included introductions to
  enzymes using <em>Biochemistry is Fun</em> card arrangements, a
  "toothpickase" activity (with very cold water &ndash; students won't
  soon forget that temperature affects rate!), and an exploration of
  the activity of catalase from vegetables and how different
  conditions affect activity.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, students also did more sophisticated activities with
  metabolism of caffeine in vitro by human cytochrome P450 1A2;
  products were analyzed by HPLC with UV detection. Students
  interfaced with the instrumentation at all levels and analyzed peak
  areas for paraxanthine and caffeine in comparison to a standard
  curve. Prior to starting the P450 assays, students learned how to
  use micropipettes with a microtiter plate pipetting design
  experience and how to make and use a standard curve. To introduce
  the concept of chromatography and separation of mixtures, students
  did simple paper chromatography with markers.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, since we live in Kalamazoo – a hotspot for extractions,
  students also learned about extraction by extracting caffeine from
  sodas – a highlight of the week. The isolated final product was
  identified by melting point analysis (and, yes, students did learn
  about Kalsec and A.M. Todd – right here in their hometown).
</p>
<p>
  In both the P450 assays and the caffeine extractions, the broader
  topics of <em>separation</em> and <em>identification</em> techniques
  were explored. Students also started learning about how to keep a
  laboratory notebook and prizes were given on the last day for the
  best notebooks. My favorite mantra (just ask my students) is "I
  can’t teach you all the chemistry you will need to learn, but I can
  teach you habits that all chemists follow"; keeping a laboratory
  notebook is one of those.
</p>
<p>
  During lunch breaks each day, summer students had lunch in small
  groups with either undergraduate research scientists doing research
  in Chemistry or Biology at Kalamazoo College this summer (we have
  over 20 undergraduate research scientists doing research in Dow this
  summer!) or with STEM faculty from the College. If you'd like to
  volunteer your lunch break to join us in summer 2017, please let
  Laura Furge know. We would welcome sharing of your experiences,
  insights, and career stories.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks to the students in the spring 2016 Advanced Biochemistry
  laboratory course at Kalamazoo College for testing activities,
  drafting protocols, and preparing some slides for use with the
  program. A very special thank you to Mr. Mike Walsh, Director of
  Chemistry Laboratories at Kalamazoo College, for preparing
  laboratory equipment and space for the experiments.
