<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  Dear KACS Members:
</p>
<p>
  Currently, the Great Lakes Region (GLR) has a forum on the ACS
  Network: <a href="http://acs.org/GLR" title="GLR website">http://acs.org/GLR</a>.
  GLR cannot exist forever with only this limited forum, as we'll need
  to link and archive Great Lakes Regional Meeting (GLRM) program
  information and other historical information. We're not so much
  concerned with past GLRM, but we will post the final programs, etc.
</p>
<p>
  So, the question we request that you consider is the
    following: <strong>is anyone willing to be GLR webmaster?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The GLR webmaster will not need to design the GLR website,
    just maintain it.</strong> GLR is prepared to pay a vendor for
    design services and the GLR website committee will send a request
    for proposal (RFP) after a webmaster is on board; GLR cannot have
    a site with random ads scrolling. It's a good idea to have a
    webmaster in place during the design, to make sure the webmaster
    is comfortable. Ideally, <strong>the webmaster should plan to do
    this for several years.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Do not hesitate to contact me with your interest, and Joe Sabol
  (<a href="mailto:jsabol@chem-consult.com">jsabol@chem-consult.com</a>),
  chair of the GLR website development committee with any questions.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you,<br />
  Lydia E. M. Hines<br />

  Great Lakes Region Board Chairman<br />

<h1 id="call-for-volunteers">Call for Volunteers</h1>

<p>
  ACS Members, my interests this year involve coordinating activities
  to bring us together and to understand your needs from the local and
  national ACS organization. Unfortunately, we have not been able to
  enjoy such activities in person, such as the 50 th anniversary of
  Earth Day. However, activities such as seminars or information
  sharing could be available via video. <strong>Is there interest out
  there?</strong>
</p>

<h2>Call for Volunteers</h2>

<p>
  This time of year, many chemists share their talents with science demonstrations at
their local or childrenâ€™s schools. Would people be interested in making a video that
could be shared with your school? Other ideas? Do you know a teacher to ask about
  interest in such a program?
</p>
<p>
As always, any undertaking of our local section requires volunteers. Your Executive
Committee has identified three areas of interest that require expertise that you may
have and be willing to contribute this year.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <strong>Education Committee</strong> is looking for those
    interested in supporting our yearly chemistry test that ultimately
    provides the higher scoring students with a monetary award. Also,
    this committee seeks to partner with science teachers in Allegan,
    Van Buren, and Kalamazoo counties.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Kalamazoo Local ACS</strong> Website is undergoing
    renovation to a more user-friendly version. We are in need of
    volunteers to maintain and regularly update the site with useful
    information.</li>
  <li>A <strong>Regular Monthly Newsletter</strong> facilitates
    communication among members. Our editor is looking for volunteers
    to contribute articles and photos of interest on our activities
    and areas of interest to our section.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  I hope some of these thoughts and activities pique your interests to volunteer. Please
  contact any Local ACS Committee member for more information.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks,<br />
  Edward Thomas
