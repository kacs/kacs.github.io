<p>
  An <strong>early announcement</strong> about our section's
  participation in <em>Chemists Celebrate Earth Day</em>; we once
  again hope to have outreach events at the Celery Flats in Portage
  and at the Kalamazoo Nature Center, and at any other venues where we
  can have interested volunteers. Note that this outreach event is in
  its <strong>15th year</strong> and has been re-labeled <em>Chemists
    Celebrate Earth Week</em> (CCEW); it will be
  celebrated <strong>April 22-28, 2018</strong>, the topic
  is <em>Oceans</em> and the theme of the publication from the ACS
  Outreach office will be <em>Dive into Marine Chemistry</em>, which
  will discuss the chemistry of water from the ocean. The common goal
  for CCEW, as well as any other activity of our ACS, is to
  communicate the positive role that chemistry plays in the world.

<h1 id="chemistry-and-art">Chemistry and Art</h1>

<p>
  KACS is considering hosting an evening of <em>Chemistry &amp;
    Art</em> - specifically <strong>chemists painting</strong>!
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
      The proposed three hour event would be help at the local
      family-owned business,
      <a href="https://happyourart.com/"
	 title="Happy Our Art website">Happy Our Art</a>, where one of their
      trained artists would guide our group in painting the same
      chemistry-themed image on a 16" &times; 20" canvas. No art training
      is required! Only the desire to have fun and learn something new!
    </p>
    <p>
      This establishment can hold up to 50 people with a minimum of 15
      attendees. ACS would provide light refreshments, but the venue is
      BYOB so participants are also able bring their preferred food and
      beverage. Typical cost of $35 per person, but the cost may vary
      depending upon the number of individuals who attend. We are thinking
      to do this a weeknight in late March or early April. Depending on
      the interest, we may also have a short speaker.

  K-College ACS Chapter Battle of the Chem-Club Victors!
</h1>

<p>
  The Kalamazoo College ACS chapter is happy to report that they won
  the <em>Battle of the Chem Clubs 2018!</em> As the winners, they
  took home the Separatory Funnel Trophy (image shown of entire
  team). They also earned the much-coveted <em>Grenade Award</em> for
  the best performance during the speed titration semi-final (image of
  award winning titration team also shown). The Battle of the Chem
  Clubs started in 2007 and is hosted at Michigan State
  University. There were approximately 80 ACS student participants
  from 12 Michigan colleges and universities. Exciting events include
  periodic table darts, a spectroscopy interpretation challenge, dry
  ice curling, and jeopardy-style questions with buzzers. This is a an
  exciting day and a great networking opportunity for young chemists.

<h1 id="leadership-institute">Report - ACS Leadership Institute</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia E.M. Hines</p>

<p>
  The ACS Leadership Institute (LI) gathering is held annually for
  newly-elected leaders of ACS Local Sections and Divisions to gather
  for ~48 hours over the third weekend of January to interact with ACS
  staff and leadership. There are <em>tracks</em> for Division
  leaders, Region Leaders, and Local Section Leaders for the most
  beneficial interaction of leaders in each of these tracks. The
  well-designed Leadership Courses developed by ACS since 1965 are
  also offered to participants. There were many opportunities to share
  <em>best programs</em> and <em>practices</em> with the large group
  so all could benefit from others' processes and successes, as well
  as to learn about pitfalls to avoid.
</p>

<p>
  At LI, we were regularly reminded about writing reports of our
  activities as they occur through the year and placing them in FORMS
  in preparation for the Annual Report submission. Another recurrent
  theme was that members are more likely to read "Social Media" such
  as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc., than e-mails, or the website,
  though sections were encouraged to maintain a website (note that our
  KACS Section does have a facebook pages and website).
</p>

<p>
  Another topic of conversation at the LI was that it is disappointing
  that many members are not aware of our Society's member-friendly
  programs and amazing services. There is
  the <a href="http://www.acs.org">ACS website</a> but it has MANY
  layers of information through which to navigate to get to what one
  needs. In the next Newsletter I will present some information about
  ACS's career offerings; below I will talk about the
  often-misunderstood difference between Districts and Regions:
</p>

<p>
  The ACS has many opportunities for service to its members and to the
  public - the Local Section (LS) is one of them. <strong>Members are
  assigned</strong> to a LS based on their mailing address of record -
  any who report an address with zip codes in <strong>Kalamazoo,
  Allegan or Van Buren counties are assigned to the Kalamazoo Local
  Section</strong>. Members may request re-assignment to a local
  section of their choice. Members of a Section are encouraged to
  <strong>inform the section's leadership of programs which would
    interest them, and to participate in section activities</strong>
    which are announced through use of our Facebook page, our
    newsletter, e-blasts, and on our website, which has a list of
    current officers - <strong>we would love to hear from
    you!</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Local Sections are assigned to <strong>Voting Districts</strong>, of
  which there are 6, each with an elected voting representative on the
  Board of Directors (BoD). Per our National ACS Bylaws, Districts
  must have approximately equal numbers of members, so occasionally
  individual local sections may be moved to a new district - Kalamazoo
  moved from District II to District V about 4 years ago - There are
  also six Directors-at-Large on the ACS BoD.
</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <img src="/images/regions-map-2017.png" alt="ACS regions map" />
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Another, non-bylaw-mandated, <strong>grouping of Local Sections is
    the Region</strong>, a geographical area of local sections
    initiated around the time of WWII, which gave ACS members
    opportunity to meet in a smaller, more accessible and affordable
    professional meeting format than at the two national meetings, to
    present scientific papers and form networks for professional
    enhancement. There are <strong>10 Regions</strong>. Our Kalamazoo
    Section is part of the <string>Great Lakes Region</string>
    (GLR). As a result of comments and concerns expressed at the LI we
    should see a current, better delineated Region map in the
    foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
  Some of you may remember that in 2015 our KACS co-hosted a Regional
  Meeting with the Western Michigan Section, which belongs to the
  Central Region, in Grand Rapids (the JGLCRM2015); many of you
  attended, organized symposia, and presented your research orally or
  on posters. The Huron Valley Section, in the Central Region, has
  <strong>invited our Section to co-host a joint meeting</strong> with
  them again in 2027! Who is willing to work at that??
</p>

<p>
  In the next Newsletter I would like to highlight a very useful ACS
  career service which was brought up at the LI as a result of a
  <em>collaborative project</em> idea presented by the Huron Valley
  section representative and the Kalamazoo section rep (me).

<h1 id="lit-review">Bonus Feature: Literature Review</h1>
<h2>Quantum Mechanics and Photosynthesis</h2>
<p class="author">By Steve Seacrest</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      Say what now? I know, didn't see that coming, but it looks that
      plants (and some bacteria and algae) use quantum mechanics to do
      photosynthesis. Here is briefly my understanding of how this
      discovery has come about and the current state of research (as
      interpreted by my mind's limited ability to follow Hamiltonian
      and Eigen-state discussions before it says I'm blown, let's get
      a margarita).
    </p>

    <h3>By the end of last millennium (2000)</h3>
    <p>
      Much of the anatomical and chemical reaction features of
      photosynthesis had been worked out. The overall reaction scheme was
      understood as plants use sunlight to convert water and carbon
      dioxide to sugar and molecular oxygen, via a series of light
      dependent (light harvesting) and independent (Calvin Cycle)
      reactions. The light dependent, light harvesting part of this deal,
      which is what makes plants and photosynthetic bacteria and algae
      special, is what we're interested in here.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <img class="img-default img-responsive"
	 src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/photosynthesis-overview.png"
	 alt="Photosynthesis overview" />
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  A low-to- high zoom-in magnification of the plant anatomy involved in light harvesting
  (shown below) goes like this:
  <ul>
    <li>plant leaves are made of plant cells</li>
    <li>the plant cells involved in light harvesting contain 10-50 chloroplasts</li>
    <li>chloroplasts are semi-autonomous organelles containing series of
      stacked membranous sacs called thylakoids</li>
    <li>thylakoid membranes contain the light harvesting photosystems (and other proteins
      involved in electron transport, proton pumping and ATP synthesis)</li>
  </ul>
  This is an extremely efficient money laundering scheme with hot
  photonic energy being converted to bankable NADPH and ATP, the
  accepted currency for cellular financial transactions.
</p>

<img class="img-default img-responsive"
     src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/plant-cell-diagram.png"
     alt="Plant-cell diagram" />

<p>
  To get to the quantum mechanical part of the story, we need to
  discuss the photosystems in the thylakoid membrane (II and I in the
  diagram) at the molecular level.
</p>

<p>
  By the end of the last millennium the thylakoid membrane
  photosystems were known to be protein complexes that contained
  embedded pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids), oriented in the
  thylakoid membrane as a reaction center surrounded by an antenna
  complex. Here are two different examples of photosystem diagrams.
</p>

<img class="img-default img-responsive"
     src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/thylakoid-space.png"
     alt="thylakoid space" />

<p>
  And the light harvesting mechanism was explained as a chlorophyll
  molecule takes a photon in the face, exciting one of its electrons.
  The excited electron is passed from chlorophyll molecule-to-
  molecule (and sometimes to carotenoids) and before the electron's
  excitement wears off, it arrives at the Reaction Center where it is
  stabilized and sent out of the photosystem to be part of the
  electron transport chain. The antenna system allows multiple
  chlorophyll molecules to be snagging photons in concert, feeding a
  steady stream of excited electrons to the Reaction System for
  processing. A very elegant design.
</p>

<img class="img-default img-responsive"
     src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/energy-levels.png"
     alt="spectra and energy levels" />

<h3>By the mid-2000's decade</h3>

<p>
  Photosystem Complex structural and functional characterization data were becoming
  much more detailed, and as often happens, the new data challenged the understanding
  of the light harvesting dynamics. Structural data coming out indicated:
  <ul>
    <li>photosystems are complexes of protein subunits of 25-55 kD
      size</li>
    <li>they contain 250-300 chlorophylls and 80-100 carotenoids per
      Reaction Center</li>
    <li>the dense pigment packing means that pigment molecule centers
      are 10Å apart</li>
    <li>the densely packed pigment structure means that excited
      electrons being randomly passed between chlorophylls could be
      handed off roughly 10-400 times before reaching the Reaction
      Center</li>
  </ul>

  And advances in electronic spectroscopy allowed measurements of
  Photosystem excitation kinetics, from photon hitting a chlorophyll,
  to excited election capture in the Reaction Center. Data indicated:
  
  <ul>
    <li>the entire process takes about 1-5 picoseconds</li>
    <li>energy capture efficiency is 90% under low light
      conditions</li>
    <li>and light harvesting is quenched under intense light
      conditions to prevent piling up excited electrons too fast in
      the Reaction Centers.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<img class="img-default img-responsive"
     src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/protein-structures.png"
     alt="protein structures" />

<p>
  What didn't match up considering these data is how excited electrons
  could randomly be passed among up to 400 pigment molecules and
  arrive at the reaction center in 5 picoseconds still containing 90%
  of their initial photon-excited energy.
</p>

<p>Something else had to be going on.</p>

<p>
  One of the things going on looked to be how the chlorophylls handled
  photon-excited electrons. Studies using 2D-electronic spectroscopy
  indicated that because the pigment molecules are spatially very
  close to each other, 2-3 chlorophyll molecules at a time share the
  excited electrons via resonance, the shared system being termed an
  exciton. The application of excitons means fewer excited electron
  hand-offs to get to the Reaction Center. It also makes light
  harvesting more efficient in that excitons can handle multiple
  excited electrons, at different energy levels simultaneously. And
  the excitation decay rate in excitons is significantly slower than
  for individual pigment molecules.
</p>

<img class="img-default img-responsive"
     src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/exciton-diagram.png"
     alt="Excitons diagram" />

<p>
  Then toward the end of the 2000's, some landmark experimental work
  was done by researchers using the 2D-electronic spectroscopy
  techniques developed to study the chlorophyll excitons. They
  studied the excitation dynamics of individual protein-pigment
  subunits hit with femtosecond-pulsed lasers. The data from these
  studies showed (among other things):
  <ul>
    <li>evidence of chlorophylls spatially distant from the site of
      laser light contact basking in the afterglow of excitation</li>
    <li>evidence of excited electrons having apparently been passed
      energetically uphill rather than following the downhill path of
      least resistance</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  These data led to the remarkable conclusion that the photon-induced
  excitation energy was being passed through the protein-pigment
  subunit via a quantum coherent mechanism. A conclusion supported by
  theoretical calculations indicating the energy electronics and
  spatially orientation of the chlorophyll molecules were suitable for
  supporting quantum coherence.
</p>

<p>
  The proposal that quantum coherence is used within the Photosystems
  to transfer excited electrons to the Reaction Centers almost
  instantaneously, with almost no energy loss, is consistent with the
  available data (and just felt right).
</p>
<p>
  However, there was the very nagging question of how does the
  femtosecond-scale quantum coherence observed in isolated
  protein-pigment subunits translate to picosecond-scale coherence in
  the much larger, very environmentally noisy Photosystem Complexes?
</p>

<img class="img-default img-responsive"
     src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/energy-diagram.png"
     alt="Energy diagram" />

<h3>And now well into the 2010's</h3>

<p>
  Additional experiments with protein-pigment complexes and even
  larger Photosystem Complexes continue to demonstrate that quantum
  coherence does indeed occur during light harvesting. And in trying
  to understand how quantum coherence can be prolonged for picoseconds
  in a noisy biological system at 10-40 C (280-310 K), research has
  become focused on the photosystem matrix proteins.
</p>
<p>
  The matrix proteins of the Photosystem protein-pigment subunits, in
  addition to providing a scaffolding holding the chlorophyll and
  carotenoid pigment molecules in place, are also the pigment
  molecules' contact with their surrounding environment. It's the
  vibrational energy of the proteins that relay external environmental
  information to the pigment molecules. And researchers have found
  that the protein vibrational energy is on the same order as the
  pigment molecules' spectral energy, so they readily interact.
</p>
<p>
  Research has now shown that the vibrational energy of the matrix
  proteins, which is affected by environmental factors like
  temperature and degree of sunlight exposure, controls the overall
  excited pigment quantum coherence interference patterns of the
  Photosystems. The vibrational control afforded by the proteins
  prolongs beneficial quantum coherence, directing excited electrons
  toward the Reaction Centers, while resulting in decoherence of
  non-beneficial superposition wave functions.
</p>
<p>
  This is where one has to say Holy Caesar Salad Batman! Not only have
  these photosynthetic biological systems learned to use quantum
  mechanics, they've learned how to control the mechanics to create
  balanced, mixed coherent-decoherent systems.
</p>
<p>
  This optimized approach applied to photonic energy harvesting for
  photosynthesis has been termed noise-assisted coherent excitation
  energy transport, and explains how chlorophyll electrons can be
  excited by photons, then transported and captured in 1-5
  picoseconds, while losing &lt;10% of their energy.
</p>

     src="/images/lit-review-photosynthesis/orbital-diagram.png"
     alt="Exciton orbital diagram" />

<h3>Getting ready to head into the 2020's</h3>

<p>
  Researchers are investigating how man-made solar power systems can
  be made more efficient by mimicking these photo-harvesting
  techniques. Areas under development include genetic manipulation of
  biological systems to further improve light harvesting, and the
  incorporation of biological components into synthetic solar power
  devices.
</p>
<p>
  And as a classic case of once we recognize something we start seeing
  it everywhere, researchers are now seeing evidence that the
  controlled use of quantum mechanics is happening in other bio-system
  functions including magneto-navigation (in bird migration) and
  olfaction (in animals and humans). The term Quantum Biology has
  started to be used as a name for the biosystem use of quantum
  mechanics.
