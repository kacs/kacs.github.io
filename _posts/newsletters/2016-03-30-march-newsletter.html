    <h2>How undergraduate research can change students' lives</h2>

  Undergraduate research is a powerful teaching method that can have a
  profound impact on students, their perceptions of themselves, and
  their visions of their future. It can be especially powerful when
  working with students from underrepresented groups and
  non-traditional students. With generous funding from the National
  Science Foundation and the Undergraduate Research Collaborative
  (URC) program, almost 300 students from 10 Chicago-area community
  colleges did authentic, faculty-mentored undergraduate research as
  part of the STEM-ENGINES URC. This paper will present data from the
  Survey of Undergraduate Research Experiences assessment and case
  studies that illustrate how undergraduate research supports student
  transfer and eases the shock of institutional transfer beyond the
  community college. Overall, these experiences promoted students'
  academic achievement, built their critical workforce skills, and
  increased their confidence regarding further study in
  chemistry. Over half of these students transferred to a four-year
  college. Students from underrepresented groups and first-generation
  college students were strongly impacted.

<h3>The Great Indoors - Your Home's Ecosystem</h3>

Kalamazoo Nature Center (10am - 4pm)<br/>

<p>
  KACS will continue its 5-year tradition of participation at the
  Kalamazoo Nature Center during its Earth Day event (entry to the KNC
  is free to the public on that day!).  During the hours of 10am and
  4pm KNC patrons will be treated to hands-on projects and
  theme-relevant materials; the response from those who have attended
  in prior years has been very enthusiastic. Thank-you very much to
  the WMU Chem Club for volunteering to staff this event!
</p>

<p>
  Since the Kalamazoo and Portage libraries will not be having Earth
  Day events this year we have applied to participate in the City of
  Portage Green-a-thon event, also on Saturday, April 23, at Celery
  Flats, from 11am to 3pm. Those of us who volunteer will be prepared
  to do hands-on activities with patrons as well as hand out
  theme-related materials which can be used off-site for further
  learning. Lydia Hines will provide the safety-tested printed
  materials that ACS prepares for us. <b>We need at least 3 volunteers
  for the Celery Flats event.</b> If you want to enjoy the outdoors while
  positively representing chemists to the public, then please <strong>contact
    Lydia E. M. Hines very soon!</strong>

  KACS has reserved a block of tickets for members who are interested in
  attending the Alton Brown Live show on Thursday, May 5th at 7:30 PM. The
  well-known television personality and author has a knack for explaining
  kitchen science in an engaging and entertaining manner. Don’t worry,
  though, our tickets are out of the “splash zone”. The KACS seating will be
  near the back of the orchestra level, and tickets are $35 each (after our KACS
  subsidy).

<h1 id="project-seed">Project Seed Opportunities</h1>
<img src="/images/project-seed/project-seed-logo.jpg" alt="Project Seed Logo" />

<h3>Project SEED opportunity</h3>

<p>
  Project SEED was established by the American Chemical Society (ACS)
  in 1968 to provide economically disadvantaged high school students
  the opportunity to conduct hands-on research for 8 to 10 weeks in
  the summer. Selected students receive a fellowship award and will be
  eligible to apply for a SEED college scholarship.
</p>

<p>
  In the summer of 2015, two students were awarded Project SEED
  opportunities. Jacob Wasylliw worked with Dr. Szymcznya at Western
  Michigan University (WMU) on a project titled “Bioinformatics of
  Tanapox Virus Proteome”.  Kathryn Way worked with Dr. Guda at WMU on
  a project titled "Optical Spectroscopy to Monitor Ligand-DNA Binding
  Interactions".
</p>

<p>
  This year the Kalamazoo ACS (KACS) is looking to fill two Project
  SEED positions. One will be with Dr Szymczyna and one will be with
  Dr. Guda.To qualify the student must have completed his or her
  sophomore year in good academic standing, have taken at least one
  course in chemistry, and be recommended by their chemistry teacher
  or other school official. Students are selected based on their
  qualifications and letters of recommendation. High school chemistry
  teachers should have received a letter detailing the project and
  nominating process. If you have not received the letter or need more
  information please contact Don Schreiber, Project SEED Coordinator
  or Mike Walsh, KACS Education Chair.

    <h3>Annual Competitive Chemistry Exam</h3>
    <p>
      On March 22nd, 2016, fifteen high schools in the Kalamazoo
      American Chemical Society (KACS) local section administered the
      annual preliminary Competitive Chemistry Exam. The top three
      scoring students from each school and all students who score in
      the top 10% on this exam will be invited to sit for the final
      exam scheduled for April 23rd, 2016 at Western Michigan
      University. The top 20 scorers on the final exam will receive
      cash awards at the Annual KACS Awards Program (see previous

<h3>The "Like KACS on Facebook winner" is&hellip;. Andrew Franks!</h3>
<p>
  Andrew, a scientist at Pfizer, only needed to do three simple things
  to win - he liked KACS on Facebook, shared a post, and commented on
  a post. For those actions he gets a copy of of "Mauve" by Simon
  Garfield. Congrats Andrew! However, we all are lucky as Andrew has
  promised to post a short book review on the Facebook page!
