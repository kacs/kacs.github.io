    <p>
      First and foremost, please look below for an invitation to join us
      on Thursday, February 23rd from 6-9:30 at the Air Zoo in Portage
      to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the KACS. We will have the
      Air Zoo to ourselves, four of the attractions will be running, we
      will have a talk on the SR-71 Blackbird, and plenty of social time
      and a nice dinner. Tickets are $10 for age 12 and over and free
      to children 11 and under. Please see page 3 and 4 for more details
      and registration information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also like to take a moment and thank all of you for
      participating in our events over the last few years, and
      especially for volunteering your time to help further our common
      goals. Every volunteer organization runs on the energy and
      commitment of its members, and I am thankful for all of the hours
      KACS members contributed to making the events of the last few
      years successful. I have enjoyed every event I attended as chair
      - from the Joint Great Lakes / Central Regional Meeting last
      spring to our Recycle-A-Poster event this past month and
      everything in between. Even though my time as chair comes to a
      close at the end of the month, I cannot wait to see what the next
      75 years has in store for the KACS. Knowing this community, we
      can all expect great things!

<h1 id="climate-change-symposium">Climate Change Symposium</h1>
<p class="author">
  By Elke Schoffers (KACS Publicity and ACS Symposium Organizer)
</p>

<p>
  KACS' commitment to supporting <strong>Climate Change</strong> began
  last year by including a half-day session <em>Climate Science
    Symposium</em> at the American Chemical Society Joint Great Lakes /
  Central Regional Meeting (ACS JGLCRM), on May 27th, 2015, in Grand
  Rapids, MI. The symposium brought together climate change
  researchers, from the field of Environmental Science and Climatology
  with policy makers, to discuss problems and share solutions related
  to regional and global climate change. The conference also included
  societal topics on climate change. 
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
      KACS continued its support for <strong>climate change
	education</strong> this year by co-sponsoring a half-day
	symposium at the 251st ACS National Meeting in San Diego, CA,
	on March 15, 2016, titled <em>The Science and Perception of
	Climate Change</em>. The goal was to disseminate the latest
	research updates and to identify ways that help engage a more
	scientifically literate public that in turn would be more
	supportive of the sciences and its practitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symposium featured scientists from a broad background to
      discuss the <strong>risks, responsibilities, politics and
      policies</strong> of climate change. The symposium was well
      attended with up to 70 attendees and concluded with a panel
      discussion titled <em>When Facts Don't Matter</em>. Among
      others, the lineup included Bassam Shakhashiri (past ACS
      President), Jerry Bell (U. of Wisconsin, ACS Climate Science
      Toolkit developer) and Andrew Hoffman (University of Michigan),
      who is the author of <em>How Culture Shapes the Climate Change
      Debate</em>. Presentations by the invited speakers, along with
      their affiliations and their presentation titles, are listed
      below.

      KACS hosted its annual poster session titled <em>Sustainable Science
	&ndash; Recycle a Poster</em> at Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute; in
      downtown Kalamazoo on Nov. 15, 2016. For the 6th year in a row,
      KACS organized this public event, which was made possible through
      a generous grant from Zoetis. As before, there were many research
      posters in addition to a keynote speaker. Over 110 people
      attended this social gathering; 49% of the attendees were ACS
      members.

  Dr. McTier discussed the discovery and development of sarolaner
  (Simparica<sup>&reg;</sup>) in Zoetis' labs here in Kalamazoo in his
  talk <em>Discovery and Development of Simparica<sup>&reg;</sup> &ndash; A Novel
    Companion Animal Isoxazoline Parasiticide</em>. He is Therapeutic
  Area Head for Companion Animal Parasitology and Research Director in
  Global Therapeutics Research, Veterinary Medicine Research and
  Development at Zoetis in Kalamazoo, MI. This drug is a novel
  isoxazoline derivative and has unique structural features important
  for its potency and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.

  Event visitors had a chance to enjoy hot appetizers and beer from 5
  to 9 pm while listening to the keynote speech, mingling and
  reviewing the posters that were given. There were 28 new or
  "recycled" (from a previous conference) posters highlighting
  scientific results from Zoetis, Kalamazoo College and Western
  Michigan University (WMU), among others. Some work was done in
  collaboration with other institutions. There were 15 student
  presenters from WMU; 8 from Kalamazoo College and one student from
  Portage High School. The local section also gave out three $50 cash
  prizes, which were drawn from the pool of poster presenters who
  submitted an abstract early. KACS Treasurer Andre R. Venter
  delivered the prizes to the winners: Lainey R. Barber, Nicole
  L. Burke and Haider Faraj.

  The Kalamazoo Local Section also used this popular event as an

  financial support that Zoetis has provided to help defer the

<h2>Looking for a Good Read?</h2>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  As part of our National Chemistry Week celebration in 1994 our Local
  Section invited Dr. Joseph Nagyvary, a chemistry professor from
  Texas A&amp;M, to speak on his research on the chemistry of the wood
  used in <strong>Stradivarius violins</strong>. He gave his
  presentation at the Dalton Recital Hall at WMU where we had invited
  violinists from the Kalamazoo Symphony with their "name violins", as
  well as Edith Hines, a young aspiring violinist at the time who used
  one of Dr. Nagyvary's violins, for a recital - this would offer
  "comparisons" of the various violins. Our Section received a Phoenix
  Award (now called ChemLuminary Award) for that unique
  event. Dr. Nagyvary is from Hungary; he is now retired and has
  written a memoir describing his experiences as a young student in
  Eastern Europe under adverse political circumstances.
