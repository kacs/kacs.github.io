      Soon our students are going back to school. Soon they will be
      listening to teachers, going to the library and writing things.
      Many of the final copies of their writing efforts will be printed
      using laser jet printers. These printers use a Xerographic process
      which does not involve inks.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, printed materials the students use in their studies
      involve inks. In addition, the students may write notes about the
      lectures which they attend, and the references which they read.
      These notes may be written using graphite pencils, but in many
      cases they are written in ink. Thus, even in this digital age, ink
      plays a large part in education. There are many varieties of
      inks. There are fountain pen inks, ballpoint pen inks, roller ball
      inks, printer inks, colored inks and, of course, the traditional
      black ink. The most ancient inks are black inks. Ancient Chinese
      inks used soot and collagen from animal sources. In India similar
      carbon based inks were used. Inks based upon carbon black and
      gelatin are still on the market today under the name <em>India
	Ink</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Colored inks may be based upon soluble dyes or pigment
      particles. The soluble dyes are soluble in the carrier, and once
      the ink is applied to the paper, the carrier evaporates, and the
      ink remains in the substrate. This is fine unless the substrate
      becomes wet and the dye migrates. In general dye inks are not as
      stable as pigment inks, although in recent years dye inks have
      improved.  Pigments are solid colored particles suspended in a
      carrier. They can be very stable although they provide a smaller
      color pallet than dye inks. So as the new school year starts let
      the ink flow.

<h2 id="ncw-announcement">Call for National Chemistry Week Volunteers</h2>

<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  <strong>Second and last (?) call for volunteers for our 2015
    National Chemistry Week (NCW) outreach event &ndash; <em>Chemistry
    Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  National Chemistry Week is creeping up on us as September
  approaches!  The Week itself is October 19-25 but our annual
  outreach event at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum will be
  on <strong>Saturday 11 October from noon to 4 p.m.</strong> This
  year's theme is <em>The Sweet Side of Chemistry &ndash; Candy</em>
  and our hard-working collaborator at the Museum, Annette
  Hoppenworth, is looking forward to the successful execution of this
  immensely popular program for the 28th time!  A sincere Thank You to
  the six individuals who have already said they would help, but we
  truly need many more!  Adults as well as the children become active
  learners at the activity smorgasbord, and they all appreciate the
  written information which they take to their homes and their schools
  for encouragement in their science learning - inquisitive and truly
  curious patrons and happily engaged presenters make for a great
  experience.
</p>

<p>
  To volunteer for the event please
  contact <a href="/people/hines.html"
	     alt="contact page for Lydia Hines">
    Lydia E. M. Hines</a>; if you are at a loss for an activity,
  she has a list she can send you, and she can train you in an
  activity of your choice. We count on you to volunteer your time and
  engaging disposition for its success again this year. Thank you!

<p>
  Over two summer months our KACS, once again under the leadership of
  Dr. Donald Schreiber of WMU, helped to support the research
  engagement of 2 SEED [Science Experience for the Economically
  Disadvantaged] students from high schools in our Local Section’s
  geographic area. <strong>Kathryn Way</strong>, a junior from
  Comstock High School, worked in the laboratory of Dr. Ramakrishna
  Guda, and <strong>Ixtlazihuatl Soto</strong>, a senior from Loy
  Norrix High School, studied in the lab of Dr. Gellert Mezei; both
  mentors are faculty in the chemistry department at WMU and we
  appreciate their generous contribution to our students’ growth as
  aspiring scientists.
</p>
<p>
 Each of these 2 students prepared a poster and responded to
 visitors’ queries concerning their work, from 10 a.m. to 12 noon on
 Wednesday August 6, 2014 in the Haenicke Hall atrium on the WMU
 campus. Several KACS members came by to visit with these students;
 Kathryn, a junior, anticipates being back next year, and
 Ixtlazihuatl is now enrolled at Northern Michigan University to
 study criminal justice/forensics and, because of her summer
 experience, thinks she may also major in chemistry!

    ChemLuminary Awards</h1>

    <h2>KACS earns two ChemLuminary Awards in San Francisco</h2>
    <p class="author">By Elke Schoffers</p>
    <p>
      It was a privilege to represent our Local Section at the16th Annual
      ChemLuminary Awards celebration during the 248th ACS National
      Meeting in San Francisco, CA, on August 12, 2014. The goal of the
      ceremony was to recognize local sections, regional meetings, and
      divisions for their efforts to promote chemistry and the chemical
      sciences during 2013.
    </p>

</div>

<p>
  The evening began with a reception during which finalists displayed
  posters and banners to highlight their outstanding activities being
  recognized. The awards presentation was opened by ACS President Tom
  Barton and followed by a keynote address by Dr. Robert A. Pribush
  (Butler University) titled <em>Volunteerism and the Ripple Effect
  &ndash; Drop a Pebble Today!</em> He was the recipient of the 2014
  ACS Volunteer Service Award and was recognized for his exemplary
  volunteer efforts in the Indiana Local Section, with ACS Governance,
  with the ACS Exams Institute, and with Regional
  Meetings. Afterwards, the celebration continued on the dance floor
  until midnight.
</p>

<p>
  A total of 17 committees identified outstanding volunteer work by
  187 ACS Local Sections, 32 Divisions and 8 Regional Meetings in
  2013. This year, KACS was a ChemLuminary <strong>finalist in three
  categories</strong> and <strong>won the coveted price in two of
  them</strong>. As the designated representative, it was my distinct
  pleasure to walk up to the stage and accept both awards on behalf of
  our Local Section. Dr. David Gottfried, chair of the Committee on
  Public Relations and Communications, gave the first award &ldquo;to
  recognize Local Sections for outstanding efforts in promoting
  chemistry to the public.&rdquo; The <em>Chemistry & Culture:
  Elements of Dance</em> event at the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts on
  November 1, 2013 was acknowledged as the <em>Best New Public
  Relations Program of a Local Section</em>. It was made possible
  through funding by by AAAS, Aldrich Chemistry, WMU President Office,
  WMU-BTR, and Bader Fine Arts Collection.
</p>

<p>
  The second award was given by the chair of the Corporation
  Associates Committee, Dr. Dawn Mason, &ldquo;to recognize
  outstanding efforts in producing an event that benefits industry
  members or students seeking a career in industry.&rdquo; Our section
  received it for the poster session at Bell’s Eccentric Café titled
  <em>Sustainable Science &ndash; Recycle a Poster</em>, which took place on
  Oct. 8, 2013 for the third year in a row. It was made possible
  through a generous grant from Zoetis and attended by about 100
  people.
</p>

<p>
  Last but not least, I would like to thank everybody who has
  graciously volunteered his/her time when I chaired the Local Section
  for two years in a row. This recognition would not have been
  possible without this team effort!
