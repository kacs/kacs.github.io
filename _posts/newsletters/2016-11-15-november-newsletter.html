    I would like to extend a big thank you to all who participated in
    our Chemistry Day fun! You will find a full report and photos in
    the newsletter. An especially big thank-you to those who organized
    and participated in our forensics mystery. It was gratifying to
    see so many attendees working diligently to solve the mystery.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that Chemistry Day is behind us, we turn to our annual
    Sustainable Science Event at Bell's. Mark your calendar for
    Tuesday November 15th at 6 pm, and please consider bringing a
    poster - new or old - to showcase some local science. Our speaker
    this year will be Tom McTier from Zoetis, who will talk about the
    discovery and development of Simparica. Come see and hear some
    science, chat with fellow members, and don’t forget to say hello!

<h1>You are invited to a 75th birthday celebration</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia E. M. Hines</p>

<p>
  Our Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical Society (KACS) will
  be celebrating its 75th anniversary with a dinner event on the main
  floor of the Air Zoo (6151 Portage Road) on the evening
  of <strong>Thursday, 23 February 2017</strong>. We anticipate a
  presentation on the SR-71, the Executive Director of the ACS will
  join our celebration, and we will have access to 4 of the Air Zoo's
  event experiences for those who would like to take advantage of
  them. Please plan to join many of your fellow KACS members for this
  special party!

<h1 id="ncw">Report: 30th Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum</h1>
<p class="author">
  By Lydia E. M. Hines (KACS) and Annette Hoppenworth, (KVM)
</p>

<p>
  Though it was a beautiful Fall afternoon with many competing events
  in the Kalamazoo, MI, area, for four hours beginning at noon on
  October 8 at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum we saw a large number of
  enthusiastic visitors of all ages; they were treated to a
  smorgasbord of 23 hands-on activities which included 6 in an area
  that required a solution to a "mystery" heist. This was all the
  result of the hard work and enthusiasm shown by about 60 volunteers,
  approximately half of whom were high school and college/university
  students :) Their availability to work with our public and to show
  them how much they love chemistry was exemplary! The smiles on the
  children's faces, and their accompanying adults' expressed thanks,
  were the icing on the cake for the afternoon. The museum staff are
  still talking about it. The level of engagement and family
  interaction surpassed all past programs - it was noteworthy that
  parents were not on their phones but actually working and talking
  with their children. We heard several patrons ask what colleges to
  go to so that they could become a chemist. Most of our visitors were
  here for at least two hours during the 4-hour program. According to
  the latest count we reached somewhere around 700, with over 500
  people doing the CSI mystery.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <p>
    In summary, the 30th anniversary event was a <strong>tremendous
      success because of our volunteers'</strong> willingness to share time,
    talent and enthusiasm, and we applaud them. Maybe YOU can plan to
    join us in 2017 when our theme will be <em>Geochemistry -
    Chemistry Rocks</em>

<h1>2017 Great Lakes Regional Meeting</h1>
<p class="author">
  By Graeme R. A. Wyllie, General Chair, ACS Great Lakes Regional
</p>
<p>Greetings from the 2017 GLRM</p>
<p>
  It's time to get an update for the 2017 GLRM. Feel free to share
  this with any interested colleagues and contact me if you have any
  questions
  (<a href="mailto:wyllie@cord.edu">wyllie@cord.edu</a>). The meeting
  will be June 27-30th held at the Holiday Inn in Fargo, North
  Dakota, so save the date. Some specific updates in what will be an
  at least monthly email keeping people in the loop as to all things
  GLRM2017.
</p>

<h4>Symposia</h4>
<p>
  Symposium Sessions need to be submitted by Dec 15 th to Seth
  Rasmussen, contact information and the list of Symposia to date can
  be found
  at <a href="http://www.glrm2017.com/symposia.html">http://www.glrm2017.com/symposia.html</a>. If
  you wish to propose a session especially for a specific topic,
  contact Seth at the link provided. While our overarching theme is
  Energy and Sustainability, we are still interested in anything that
  will bring together colleagues from the region to share their
  science. We are also still looking for people to host some of the
  general papers in the divisions or review papers. Contact Seth if
  interested in helping out.
</p>

<h4>Awards</h4>
<p>
  We plan to award a number of regional awards at the meeting
  including the Stanley Israel award, the P3 Award, the High School
  Teacher Award and E. Ann Nalley Award for Service to the ACS
  Region. Details on all of these can be found at
  <a href="http://www.glrm2017.com/awards.html">http://www.glrm2017.com/awards.html</a>. We
  will be more actively soliciting for nomination packages soon but
  for now, check out the awards and if you have suitable nominations,
  it's a chance to begin preparing the packet. We look forward to
  seeing you in Fargo in 2017.

<h1 id="outreach">Report: Two School Outreach Programs</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>
<h4>Lake Center Elementary</h4>
<p>
  In mid-September of 2016 the chair of the PTO at Lake Center
  Elementary in Portage contacted the KACS leadership to ask for our
  help in their first-ever undertaking to present a successful evening
  of Science- Technology- Engineering- and Math-learning for their
  students and their families, in an <em>I ❤ STEM</em> event at that
  school. We are very pleased to inform you that we sent them a $300
  cash donation, as well as supplied them with written materials for
  participants to take home and continue their science learning there
  (500 copies of <em>Celebrating Chemistry</em> focused on Forensic
  Science experiments, and 500 copies focused on how chemistry is
  integral to the Colors we observe around us). Additionally, students
  from the WMU ChemClub happily agreed to present hands-on activities
  which helped the children and their parents make slime, as well as
  change common pennies to "gold" pennies. Pfizer chemists rallied to
  our request as well and offered chemistry-related activities such as
  "acid/base indicators" and "Instant Snow (super-absorbent polymer)".
</p>
<p>
  The school's PTO did a yeoman job of assembling together MANY
  southwest Michigan organizations which represent each of the aspects
  of STEM, and the crowd of more than 800 attendees during the evening
  was busily engaged at each of the 35 stations set up throughout both
  floors of the school. Each of the Lake Center Elementary students
  who came got a bag of at least 7 items to take home to continue
  their science learning; as one parent excitedly replied as she was
  pulled by her children into one of the areas, "the kids really
  wanted to come, and after all, this is real science learning". It
  was obvious that the PTO was most appreciative for our generous
  participation, as was the enthusiastic crowd on that evening of
  October 20.
</p>

<h4>Arcadia Elementary</h4>
<p>
  In late October a Chemistry Graduate Student, a member of the Iraqi
  Student Association at WMU, who had attended our Chemistry Day at
  the Museum, requested and received written materials to supplement
  his presentation on chemistry careers to about 60 Arcadia Elementary
  School Students.

<h1>Report: Ice Cream Social Event at WMU</h1>
<p>
  On September 30, 2016, the Chemistry Graduate Student Association
  (CGSA) hosted an ice cream social for the undergraduate and graduate
  students, faculty, and staff of the Department of Chemistry at WMU;
  the aim of this event was to introduce the new students to the
  existing chemistry family. With more than 60 people in attendance,
  students were able to make new connections, get to know the student
  organization, as well as catch up with old friends. Thank you to
  KACS for helping to defray some of the cost of this successful
  event.
