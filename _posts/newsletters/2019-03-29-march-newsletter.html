<h1>
  KACS Hosting 15 mile Water Stop for Kalamazoo Marathon
</h1>

<p>
  Our Kalamazoo ACS Local Section is again running the 15 mile water
  stop for this year's Kalamazoo Marathon, Sunday, 5 May. We had a
  great crew last year for this event (thanks all), and are looking
  forward to a fun time again this year. This is our call for
  volunteers.
</p>
<p>
  Below are some details and photos from last year, which will for the
  most part apply again this year.
</p>
<img src="" alt="2018 water stop" />
<p>
  Please reply to message to let me know if you can help this year, no
  experience necessary. Your help will very much be appreciated by the
  marathoners.
</p>

<h4>Water stop location</h4>
<p>
  On Oakland, near the corner of Oakland and Whites, in front of
  Christy's Consignment Shop (by Water Street Coffee), near the course
  15 mile marker.
</p>
<h4>Schedule</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>7:30&ndash;8:00</dt>
  <dd>Set up tables (3 tables to be arranged as water-GuBrew-water
    alternated), make the GuBrew (40tabs/jug of water, takes a while
    to dissolve), set up our KACS props</dd>
  <dt>8:00&ndash;9:00</dt>
  <dd>
    Fill cups half full (I've been told that one layer of filled cups
    per table is enough for this stop, and we've been requested to
    have our three tables arranged water - GuBrew - water), pass out
    volunteer t-shirts, eat provided breakfast.
  </dd>
  <dt>9:00&ndash;13:30</dt>
  <dd>
    Pass water and GuBrew cups to runners, and cheer them
      on. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81bIqZ4hn0Y&t=190s">
      This YouTube video</a> shows how to pass the water.
  </dd>
  <dt>11:00&ndash;12:00</dt>
  <dd>
    Start cleaning up discarded cups thrown in the street (course
    comes south-bound down Oakland and turns left onto Whites, so
    thrown cups will be on both Oakland and Whites, we will put out
    trash cans, but not everyone uses them) (I'll bring a snow shovel
    and leaf rake to help gather up the thrown cups, if anyone else
    can bring those, that could help).
  </dd>
  <dt>11:30&ndash;12:30</dt>
  <dd>Finish breaking down and cleaning up the site</dd>
</dl>

<p>This stop will have porta-potties available, but we don't have to
  do anything with those.</p>
