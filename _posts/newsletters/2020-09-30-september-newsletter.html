  Chemical Society announces winner of 2020 Helen M. Free Award
  for Public Outreach</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      WASHINGTON, Sept. 17, 2020 &ndash; The American Chemical Society (ACS)
      today announced Lydia E. M. Hines, Ph.D., as the recipient of the
      2020 Helen M. Free Award for Public Outreach. This award is
      presented annually by the ACS Committee on Public Relations and
      Communications (CPRC) to an ACS member whose outstanding
      achievements have improved public recognition and appreciation for
      the field of chemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to receiving this award, Hines had this to say:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Sharing chemistry, both formally and informally, to audiences from
      the very young to the young-at-heart has been part of my life for so
      long that it is both humbling and affirming to be the recipient of
      this award. This honor holds special significance for me, as I have
      had the privilege of collaborating with Helen Free over the years
      and have long admired her passion for outreach.

  Comments from
  Chair-Elect, Ed Thomas
</h1>

<p class="author">By Ed Thomas</p>

<p>
  Last month, I attended the Fall 2020 virtual ACS Meeting, which was
  to be held in San Francisco. I hadn't been to a national meeting in
  many years, so I didn't know what to expect. It was wonderful! For a
  retired ACS member, the registration fee was $125. No travel costs,
  hotels or flights. All from my own home!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Leland Jourdan</strong> the Chief Diversity Officer at
  Chevron Corporation presented a lecture on the <em>Case for
  Diversity and Inclusion</em>. He made a compelling case for defining
  diversity as more than visual to include cognitive, values,
  occupational, societal and relationships. These measures of
  diversity &ndash; blended together on teams, companies and
  organizations &ndash; make for a more successful enterprise.
</p>

<p>
  Ben Feringa, a Nobel Laureate, presented the Kavli Lecture on the
  <em>Art of Building Small</em>, involving nanotechnology and
  mechanical machines. This fascinating work combined chemistry and
  engineering on the nanoscale to produce machines that move in a
  regular fashion. It was fascinating. On a less esoteric level, but
  still scientifically rigorous, I viewed talks on measuring
  pesticides in beer and the effects of smoke on wine.
</p>

<p>
 Although I missed the energy of a national meeting in person, I was
 impressed with the quality of the presentations, the lengths to
 which ACS went to produce this four-day event, and the ease with
 which I was able to participate.

      Though our annual and very popular KACS hands-on National
      Chemistry Week (NCW) event at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum (KVM)
      will NOT happen in person, our amazing KVM contact, Mrs. Annette
      Hoppenworth, has been hard at work with a few of our volunteers
      preparing for a fun hands-on program which will be presented
      through the KVM <strong>virtually</strong> on October 17.

<p>
  Annually the ACS Committee on Community Activities encourages each
  local section to participate in a community event which corresponds
  to the chosen theme of that year's NCW; this year the NCW theme
  is <em>Sticking with Chemistry</em> (Adhesives) so the Community
  event chosen was <em>Sticking with a Cause</em> and during NCW, the
  week of October 18-24, members, students, children, are encouraged
  to <strong>choose a first responder (individual or group) to whom to
  communicate thanks for their continued service during the
  pandemic</strong>. For the purpose of statistics, our NCW
  Coordinator, <a href="/people/hines.html" alt="Contact info for Lydia">
    Lydia E. M. Hines</a>, would appreciate an e-mail letting her
  know that you did so and how.

      Unfortunately, due to the ongoing Covid19 Pandemic <strong>the 2020
	Bell's Recycle-a-Poster event</strong> which many of us look
      forward to in early November every year has been canceled.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope to resume this event in 2021 and look forward to seeing
      members of the Kalamazoo chemical community at other in-person
      events in 2021!
