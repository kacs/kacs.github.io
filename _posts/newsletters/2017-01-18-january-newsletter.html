<h1 id="anniversary-celebration">Our KACS 75th Anniversary Party!</h1>
<h2>It's right around the corner...</h2>
<div class="anniversary-party">
  <p>
    Time is getting close for our KACS 75th anniversary gala
    celebration on the main floor of the Air Zoo (6151 Portage Road)
    on the evening of Thursday, February 23, 2017, from 6-9:30 pm.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will be time to socialize, reminisce, celebrate our
    accomplishments, enjoy dinner, and be treated to a presentation on
    the SR-71.  The Executive Director of the ACS will join our
    celebration, and we will have access to four of the Air Zoo's
    event experiences (including the simulators and the 4-D theater)
    for those who would like to take advantage of them!
  </p>
  <p>
    We look forward to seeing you at this family-friendly event.  The
    cost for the buffet dinner for each attendee age 12 years and
    older will be $10.00 (young people under 12 may come at no cost)
    so please plan to join fellow KACS members and friends that
    evening for this special party!  See you there!

	ignite the fuel</li>
      <li>The SR71's "R2-D2" navigation system main sensor could detect
	>60 stars in broad daylight</li>

  Notes of Congratulations on our 75th Anniversary
</h1>
<blockquote>
  Happy Anniversary to the Kalamazoo Section! You deserve tremendous
  thanks and gratitude for your devotion to your passionate members,
  your community and our science over the past 75 years. I have no
  doubt that the next 75 years will be filled with even more events,
  outreach, and education that strengthen the Society and demonstrate
  the transforming power of chemistry.

  On behalf of Kalamazoo College, congratulations to the Kalamazoo ACS
  Chapter on 75 years of good chemistry! We at K are particularly
  appreciative of the "good chemistry" that exists between the local
  chapter, our chemistry department, and our ACS student
  group. Together, they have applied that "good chemistry" in
  community outreach and in engagement, professional development and
  networking with local scientists who practice chemistry in industry,
  government and education. That "good chemistry" has launched many
  careers and helps sustain one of the finest undergraduate chemistry
  programs in the country&hellip;right here in Kalamazoo. Thank you,
  Kalamazoo ACS, for your commitment to the love, the sharing, the
  explication and the importance of chemistry in Kalamazoo.
