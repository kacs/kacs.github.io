    <p>
      Happy 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary KACS! Taking a minute to
      reflect on that accomplishment really brings home the
      realization of just how spsssecial is this group of chemists.
      Since 1942 this relatively small ACS section has established a
      strong, successful tradition of local industrial and academic,
      scientists and students, working together to share our knowledge
      and love of chemistry within Kalamazoo and beyond. Being a
      member of this organization is truly something of which to be
      proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am grateful for the opportunity to chair our local
      section. The ACS played a key role in the start of my 32 year
      career as a pharmaceutical scientist. In 1984 as a graduating
      student member, I att
ended the ACS national meeting in
      St. Louis, and via the Employment Clearing House landed a
      position in Monsanto's new Bioprocess Development
      Group. Kalamazoo has also played a key role in my career. Since
      going to work for Upjohn here in 1988, and working through the
      Pharmacia - Pfizer - Zoetis changes, I've come to know Kalamazoo
      as an excellent community in which to live. Chairing our local
      section brings together an opportunity to connect and contribute
      to these two important pieces for me, Kalamazoo and the ACS, so
      thanks for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with our local section's outstanding and committed
      membership and Executive Committee (who have already helped me
      immensely learn the chairing ropes), I look forward to
      continuing our already established, highly regarded activities -
      the poster and speaker sessions, Earth Day and National
      Chemistry Week events, Project SEED and more. In addition, I'll
      be looking for additional opportunities to strengthen and grow
      our local section.  This is where all local section members can
      help. Please share with me and the Executive Committee any
      thoughts or ideas on what we can do to help our local section
      continue flourishing.

<h1 id="thank-you"> Thank You!</h1>

<p>
  On October 20, 2016 the PTO at Lake Center Elementary in Portage
  hosted their first evening of Science Technology Engineering and
  Math learning for their students and their families, in an <em>I
  &lt;3 STEM</em> event at that school. As we summarized in the Nov
  2016 KACS newsletter, our KACS local section helped with the event
  via cash, materials, and volunteer donations.
</p>
<p>
  Below is a thank-you note and photo collage from the Lake Center
  Elementary PTO. We hope this is the beginning of a long and
  productive partnership.

<h1 id="project-seed">Project Seed</h1>
<img src="/images/project-seed/project-seed-logo.jpg" />
<p>
  <strong>Project SEED opportunity</strong>: Project SEED was
  established by the American Chemical Society (ACS) in 1968 to
  provide economically disadvantaged high school students the
  opportunity to conduct hands-on research for 8 to 10 weeks in the
  summer. Selected students receive a fellowship award and will be
  eligible to apply for a SEED college scholarship.
</p>
<p>
  This year the Kalamazoo ACS (KACS) is looking to fill two Project
  SEED positions. To qualify a student must have completed his or her
  sophomore year in good academic standing, have taken at least one
  course in chemistry, and be recommended by their chemistry teacher
  or other school official. Students are selected based on their
  qualifications and letters of recommendation. High school chemistry
  teachers should have received a letter detailing the project and
  nominating process.

<h1 id="exams">High School Examinations</h1>

<p>
  For the thirty-sixth consecutive year, the KACS is sponsoring a
  chemistry examination competition for all high school students in
  Allegan, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren counties. The competition consists
  of a preliminary and final examination. This year the preliminary
  examination will take place on March 15 at all high schools that
  register. High scorers will be invited to the final examination on
  April 22 at Western Michigan University where they will compete for
  twenty scholarships. If you would like more information, contact a
  high school chemistry teacher or email the KACS test coordinators.
