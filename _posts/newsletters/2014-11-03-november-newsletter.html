    <p>
      Thanksgiving is almost here. Thanksgiving involves hunting
      various game birds, and hunting involves gun powder. Gun powder
      is a complex mixture containing potassium nitrate, sulfur and
      charcoal which has evolved over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gun powder was first used in pyrotechnics, but as the name
      suggests its quickly spread to fire arms. The early history of
      gunpowder is shrouded in obscurity. Gunpowder seems to have been
      invented in China. It came to Europe through trade with China,
      or perhaps it was invented independently in Europe. Whatever
      its early development may have been, it is well documented that
      by 1242 Francis Bacon knew of gunpowder, and by 1350 gun powder
      and guns existed in Europe. Gunpowder was used in grains, and
      the grain size differed for different guns. Small firearms,
      such as pistols, used small grains, while cannons used large
      grains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black powder was the propellant explosive of the world until
      1884, when Paul Vieille invented a smokeless powder called
      Poudre B made from 68.2% insoluble nitrocellulose, 29.8% soluble
      nitrocellusose gelatinized with ether and 2% paraffin. Firearms
      have used smokeless powder similar to Poudre B ever since. One
      thing has not changed &ndash; small guns use small grain powder
      and large guns use large grain powder. The largest grain powder
      is used in large cannons because this large grain powder will
      continue to burn for the relatively long time it takes to drive
      a projectile from a cannon barrel.

<h2>Present Science, Network, Mingle, Celebrate Kalamazoo Chemistry</h2>

<p><strong>Student poster presenters can win a prize!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate.</strong></p>
<p>
  The Kalamazoo area has always been historically rich with exciting
  chemistry. Please join us and share the area’s wealth of exciting
  chemistry by bringing a poster of your chemistry
  accomplishments. Your poster can either be newly prepared or a
  recycled poster from a previous event. This Mixer invites local
  academic and industrial chemists from all areas of chemistry:
  Analytical, Biochemistry, Inorganic, Organic, and Physical, in
  addition to Food and Medicinal Chemistry. See you there!  Present
  Science, Network, Mingle, Celebrate Kalamazoo Chemistry.
</p>
<p>
  This year KACS will host Professor Timothy F. Jamison (MIT) during
  its annual poster session. He will present a keynote speech on
  continuous flow chemistry. <b>Poster presenters should
  e-mail <a href="mailto:elke.schoffers@wmich.edu">
  elke.schoffers@wmich.edu</a> by Monday, November 3</b> to reserve an
  easel by sending: (a) the title of the poster, (b) a list of
  authors, and (c) institution information.

<h2>Continuous Flow Multistep Synthesis</h2>

<h4>by Keynote Speaker Prof. Tim Jamison (6 pm)</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Flow chemistry has the potential to
  revolutionize the synthesis of organic molecules. Flow systems can
  reduce reaction times, increase efficiency, and obviate problems
  often encountered in scaling up. In addition to these important
  practical advantages, flow chemistry expands the “toolbox” of
  organic reactions available to scientists engaged in the synthesis
  of molecules – from small-scale experiments to large-scale
  production. These benefits are a direct result of several features
  of flow synthesis that batch synthesis typically cannot achieve, for
  example, the ability to control fluid flow precisely, the access to
  temperature and pressure regimes not usually considered to be
  practical, and the enhanced safety characteristics of flow chemical
  systems. In this lecture we will discuss some of our investigations
  in this area in the form of case studies, wherein a specific target
  or family of organic molecules has served as an inspiration for the
  development of new methods of organic synthesis in flow.

<h2>Fall Welcome Ice Cream Social</h2>
<p class="author">By Sarut Jianrattanasawatt</p>
<p>
  On September 12, 2014, the WMU Chemistry Club and the Chemistry
  Graduate Student Association hosted an ice cream social for the
  graduate and undergraduate students, faculty and staff of the
  Department of Chemistry. With more than 40 people in attendance,
  students were able to make new connections, get to know the student
  organizations*, as well as catch up with old friends. All in all,
  this event met its aim of introducing the new students to the more
  established members of the department.

<h1>National Chemistry Week 2014</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<h2>Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum</h2>

<p>
  Saturday, October 11, was a beautiful day in Kalamazoo, a day for
  families to take a trip to the Kalamazoo Valley Museum for our
  Section’s annual <strong>National Chemistry Week</strong> outreach
  event. As in the past 27 years the staff and volunteers at the
  Museum collaborated with KACS members to present <strong>a
  successful event</strong> which was excitedly received by all who
  attended, parents and children alike – at least 800 visitors.
</p>
<p>
  More than fifty volunteers from our Section – from Kalamazoo
  College, WMU, KVCC, Zoetis, Pfizer, Gull Lake High School and
  Kellogg’s, to name some &ndash; presented 24 hands-on activities for 4
  hours non-stop; some of the activities were the old stand-bys like
  slime, dancing milk, volcano, and super-absorbent polymer; others
  were new, like how to detect sour candies from those which are not,
  to ways to be a Kitchen spy; the Mentos-pop geyser was another
  favorite. The theme this year was <em>The Sweet Side of Chemistry
  &endash; Candy</em>. A large number of written materials for Grades
  4-6 and High-School-age young people were happily received by eager
  children and adults – parents, scout leaders, teachers – who were
  there.
</p>
<p>
  Our event got some publicity through the AP Wire service (courtesy a
  Press release from the Museum Director); there was additional
  publicity in the Museum’s quarterly publication <em>Museon</em> and
  their volunteer newsletter; an article in the <em>Three Rivers
  Commercial-News</em>; advertisements in the <em>Kalamazoo
  Gazette</em>; articles and invitations in our Section e-newsletter,
  and e-blasts; and a flier supplied to K-12 teachers with the request
  that it be sent home with their students – some were. On the morning
  of the event, museum staff presented one of our activities live on
  our local TV station! Three weeks prior to the date of the event the
  publication Celebrating Chemistry, for children Grades 4-6, along
  with the announcement flyer, was distributed through our Section’s
  Public Libraries’ children’s rooms.
</p>
<p>
  Through this article I would like to extend a heart-felt <em>Thank
  You</em> to all our volunteers and the able staff at the Kalamazoo
  Valley Museum.
</p>

<h2>Illustrated Poem Contest</h2>

<p>
  Since the deadline for submission of entries to National ACS is not
  until November 15, the results of this part of the event are not in
  yet, but all K-12 teachers whose e-addresses are in hand received an
  invitation (and a subsequent reminder) to have their students
  participate in this opportunity for prize money. The deadline for
  submission locally is not until November 10, so stay tuned&hellip;
</p>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<h2>Congratulations</h2>

<p>
  We congratulate our Kalamazoo-based <strong>Stryker</strong> in
  being ranked as number 42 in the list of <strong>Top
  Chemistry-Related Companies to Work For</strong> in the January 16,
  2014 issue of Fortune magazine (see page 34 of <em>C&amp;E News</em>
  13 October 2014).
