<h1 id="chair-message">Message from Out-Going Chair</h1>
<p>
  With 2018 winding down, so is my term as KACS Chair. I want to
  take this opportunity to say thanks to all, for the support that
  I've received in this position. I very much appreciated meeting
  and interacting with members of the Kalamazoo chemistry community,
  many of whom I otherwise would likely never have met. And I really
  enjoyed being involved in KACS events like Kalamazoo Earth Day in
  Bronson Park, our Speed Networking Event for local chemistry
  students, our Voyage to Mars webinar event at Boatyard Brewing,
  and our KACS water station at the Kalamazoo Marathon. Kalamazoo is
  truly fortunate to have such a strong chemistry community.
</p>
<p>
  Moving into 2019, the International Year of the Periodic Table,
  Luke Chadwick rotates into the Chair position, so I leave the
  position knowing it is in good hands. And in 2019, I'll be
  rotating into the Immediate Past Chair role. My main job as
  Immediate Past Chair will be getting us ready for our 2019
  Kalamazoo National Historic Chemical Landmark (NHCL) dedication
  event on 16-17 May. I've spoken in past newsletters about the ACS
  NHCL program, our nomination recognizing the 1950-1990 steroid
  chemistry work of Kalamazoo chemists, and its approval. Some
  details of that work can be read in our recent
  <a href="https://p2.kvcc.edu/perf/images/uploads/1802281504dkem/kvm_pr05_Kalamazoo_ACS_NHCL_news_release.pdf"
     title="NHCL press release">news release</a>.
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      Now comes the fun part, getting ready for a party to celebrate the
      Kalamazoo work being granted NHCL status. A two-day event is
      planned for 16 May (dinner/reception) and 17 May (chemistry
      symposium and dedication ceremony). More information is provided
      in the event flier included on the next page of this newsletter,
      and on the event webpage on the KACS website. Tickets for the
      dinner/reception can be purchased using the PayPal link on the
      event webpage, and I recommend getting your dinner tickets soon,
      as seating is limited. This event is shaping up to be the local
      chemistry social event of the year. We'll continue communicating
      event planning updates as we move closer to May.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I want to close by saying thanks again for the opportunity to
      serve as KACS Chair (I recommend everyone take a turn doing this),
      and see you at future KACS events, including the 16-17 May 2019
      Kalamazoo NHCL dedication event.
    </p>
    <p>

<h1 id="voyage-to-mars">Report: Voyage to Mars</h1>

<p>
  On Mole Day (Oct 23) the Kalamazoo local section presented two
  opportunities for members and the general public to participate in
  ACS's Program in a Box: Voyage to Mars webinar/social media event.
  The program content was aligned with this year's <strong>National
  Chemistry Week</strong> theme of space exploration: <em>Chemistry is
  Out of This World.</em>
</p>

<p>
  Sessions were held at <strong>Boatyard Brewing</strong> (432
  E. Paterson St., Kalamazoo) and the <strong>Air Zoo Aerospace &amp;
  Science Museum</strong> (6151 Portage Rd, Portage).  Attendees heard
  dynamic presentations by experts from NASA, Rice, Clemson, Emory and
  the National Radio Astronomy Observatory on topics such as
  <ul>
    <li>the geologic history of Mars and future missions to advance our knowledge</li>
    <li>the unique challenges of long term human space travel</li>
    <li>waste recycling schemes that would support travel and habitation on Mars</li>
  </ul>
  Experts joined participants in live Q&amp;A dialogue at the end of the presentation.
</p>

<p>
  We also enjoyed interacting with the ACS presenters and other groups
  attending the event in multiple countries. The real-time chat room
  on the ACS event webpage, and the social media #ACSPIB connection
  really added to the event.
</p>
<p>
  The Kalamazoo local section is grateful to the Air Zoo and Boatyard
  Brewing for their assistance to bring this program to our area.  The
  Air Zoo attracted 12 participants, who enjoyed comfortable theater
  seating in a first-class facility with large screen viewing and
  high-quality audio.  The back room at Boatyard Brewing drew about
  30 participants, who enjoyed the intimate, neighborhood pub-style
  setting.

    <p>
      Though wintry temperatures came rolling in to Kalamazoo, MI, on
      Saturday, October 13, 2018, <strong>60 volunteers</strong>* (15 of
      them KACS members) - many for 4 hours and others in 2-hour shifts –
      gathered at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum (KVM) from noon to 4 pm to
      present <strong>20 activities</strong> on two floors and the large
      theater to <strong>600 patrons</strong>.  Visitors included extended
      families, scout leaders, practicing teachers, with many repeat
      visitors and several who had come as children themselves to one or
      more of our previous 31 events.  An <strong>additional
	attraction</strong> during the four-hour afternoon offerings this
      year was the inclusion by our generous host, the KVM, of <strong>3
	free planetarium</strong> shows at regular intervals.  Volunteers,
      who were solicited widely from area companies, colleges/university,
      high schools and other area science-teaching centers, were informed
      of our <strong>emphasis on safety</strong> both in terms of our own
      participation and our interactions with the attendees as they did
      the activities.  Many education-related materials from ACS and other
      sources were gladly received by our visitors who expressed
      <strong>enthusiasm</strong> about the variety of available stations
      through the afternoon, as well as about learning of the availability
      of ACS' large assortment of age-appropriate resoures; there seemed
      to be greater-than-average interest expressed in subsequent use of
      these resources to continue science learning after the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      * Volunteers were employees from Pfizer, Perrigo and Kalsec; WMU -
      faculty, retired staff and students; faculty and students from KVCC;
      and K College students; some HS chem students (Loy Norrix, Mattawan,
      Portage Northern) and others from the community (e.g., Air Zoo, KVM
      volunteers). An <strong>e-mail of appreciation</strong> was sent to
      the Museum leadership, and to each volunteer whose e-address was
      available.

<h2>More Hands-On Offerings</h2>
<h3>25 October 2018</h3>
<p>
  Among the large number of offerings presented to children and their
  families at the Lake Center Elementary (Portage)
  STEAM night <strong>for the third successive year</strong>,
  favorites were hands-on activities by our KACS Western Michigan
  University Chem club students and several of our members.  There was
  an attendance of ~600 engaged children during the 3-hour event.
</p>

<h2>Materials Distribution to Other Local Section Venues</h2>

<p>
  Copies of Celebrating Chemistry were distributed to organizations in
  our Local Section area which provide science outreach to our
  communities: copies in Spanish were donated to our <strong>Kalamazoo
  Public Library</strong> for their Hispanic Heritage Month
  celebration; copies in both English and Spanish were given to the
  <strong>Air Zoo</strong> (which also was a host site for one of our
  <emph>Voyage to Mars</emph> Program-In-A-Box presentations) for use
  in their many student programs through the year; and were
  distributed to patrons at a very successful STEAM night hands-on
  Science event at <strong>Lake Center Elementary</strong> in Portage,
  MI, on October 25, 2018, where some of our members also engaged the
  children and families in hands-on activities.
</p>

<h1 id="speed-networking">Report: Speed Networking Event</h1>

<p>
  On the evening of 26 September at the K College Hicks Student
  Center, the Kalamazoo College Chemistry Department and Career
  Planning Office cohosted with KACS, our second annual speed
  networking event for area chemistry college students.  The purpose
  of the event continues to be connecting local chemistry college
  students with local working chemists (KACS members serving as
  mentors) for information sharing.
</p>
<p>
  The event set up was like that for speed dating, with participating
  students rotating through 3-minute face-to-face time with
  participating mentors.  The students asked questions related to
  establishing and building chem-related careers and the mentors
  provided answers and information based on personal experience. The
  evening ended with refreshments and time for free-style follow-up
  interaction between the students and mentors.  KACS provided prizes
  for the participants.
</p>
<p>
  Feedback for this event, which this year had 27 mentors and 31
  students, continues to be very positive, with the desire to continue
  annually. This year's event had a first, with Kelley Current, a WMU
  Chem student participant from last year, returning this year as a
  mentor working for Pfizer, Inc., a position she achieved in part, as
  a direct outcome of participating in last year's event.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks to our co-hosts, Jackie Srodes (K College Career
  Planning Office) and Jeff Bartz (K College Chemistry
  Department). And many thanks to the KACS members that served as
  mentors: Mara Birndorf, Luke Chadwick, Jana Deering, Bridget Lorenz
  Lemberg, Julie Lorenz, John Manski, Beth Negash, Ashok Patel,
  Christine Pruis, Bill Schinzer, Susan Sheehan, Derek Sheehan, Rachel
  Wilson, Charissa Oliphant, Kim Lewis, David Erdman, Andrew Hepburn,

      from the LSAC (Local Section Activities Committee) for
      "co-hosting a meeting with a neighboring local section", this
      was a meeting co-hosted with the Huron Valley Section; several
      other local sections in MI, IN, IL were also invited to
      participate virtually using the ZOOM platform.  Though the
      number of attendees in any of the locations was small,
      Dr. Balbes presented a very informative overview of the
      opportunities available to those who choose to pursue a degree
      in chemistry and show initiative in assessing their personal
      strengths while also seeking to evaluate new avenues of personal
      growth.  Many career resources were shared that evening. For ACS

<h1 id="WMU-social">Report: WMU Ice-Cream Social</h1>

<p>
  On September 11, 2018 the Chemistry Graduate Student Association
  (CGSA) hosted an ice cream social for the undergraduate and graduate
  students, faculty, and staff of the WMU Department of
  Chemistry.  KACS helps financially to support this young-chemist
  networking event. The aim of the Ice Cream Social was to introduce
  the new students to the faculty and existing student body. The
  turnout was great, about 30 people attended, and students were able
  to make new connections, get to know the student organizations as
  well as catch up with old friends.

<h1 id="project-seed">Project SEED 50th Anniversary</h1>
<h2>Meet Andrey Malyutin</h2>
<h3>Article Two of a Three-Article Mini Series
  <emph>The Faces of Project Seed</emph></h3>

<p>
  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the ACS program Project
  SEED. Project SEED was established in 1968 to provide opportunities
  for high school students who historically lack exposure to
  scientific careers.
</p>
<p>
  For 8 to 10 weeks over the summers of their junior and senior years,
  SEED students are given the unique opportunity to work with
  scientists in academic, industry, and government research
  laboratories, who help them develop laboratory, written and oral
  skills. More information on Project SEED is available on the
  <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/seed/about.html"
     title="ACS project SEED page">ACS website</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the program, C&amp;E News is
  running a series of articles this year highlighting the experiences
  of Project SEED alumni. An example can be found
  <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i5/Happy-50th-birthday-Project-SEED.html"
     title="C&EN article">here</a>.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      This article is a similar celebration on the local level, where
      we caught up with Kalamazoo Project SEED alumnus, Dr. Andrey
      Malyutin, currently Co-Director of Caltech's Cryo-EM
      Facility. Dr. Malyutin kindly shared with us his memories of his
      Kalamazoo Project SEED experience, and its effect on his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a career it has been already. After graduating from
      Kalamazoo Central High School, Andrey earned a chemistry
      undergraduate degree at Kalamazoo College. While at K College he did
      a study abroad rotation in Japan. After K College, Andrey went on to
      earn a PhD in chemistry at Indiana University, followed by a
      post-doc at the Columbia Medical Center in New York. And now in 2018
      he has taken on the Co-Director role at Caltech's Cryo-EM Facility.

<p>
  Here are some of the questions and responses from our catch-up time
  with Dr. Malyutin.
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>
    KACS: Can you please tell us a little about how you originally
    learned about Project SEED in Kalamazoo, and what were your 2004 and
    2005 Project SEED projects? Also, what would you say were the best
    and worst parts of your Project SEED experience?
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Malyutin: My high school chemistry teacher (Kalamazoo Central
    High), Mark Branch, introduced me to Project SEED and helped me
    apply. Since reading Michael Crichton's novel <em>Prey</em> early
    in high school I was fascinated with nanotechnology. While we are
    quite far away from intelligent self-replicating nano swarms of
    Michael's world, nanomaterials hold a great potential in
    benefiting society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of my projects with Dr. Subra Muralidharan focused on
    developing efficient synthesis procedures for silica coated gold
    nanoparticles and zinc sulfide quantum dots.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best part of the project SEED experience for me was the
    introduction to a real life chemistry lab and learning how to deal
    with projects over a long period of time, in contrast to short
    term experiments of the high school curriculum. The worst part,
    looking back on it, was that I probably could have taken my
    projects more seriously. I certainly was not as dedicated nor
    efficient with my time in the lab as the undergraduate and
    graduate students that I was working along with.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p>
	KACS: Would you say that participation in Project SEED influenced
	your decision to obtain a chemistry degree at Kalamazoo College?
	While at K College you did a 6-month study abroad rotation in
	Japan. How was that experience? Would you recommend study abroad
	to today's chemistry students?
      </p>
      <p>
	Dr. Malyutin: I believe participation in Project SEED and support
	from Mark were major factors that helped me in being selected for
	the Heyl scholarship at Kalamazoo College. Part of the scholarship
	is the requirement to major in "the natural sciences, mathematics
	or computer science" and I was more than happy to fulfill this
	requirement by focusing on chemistry. It felt like a natural
	choice to continue with chemistry at a graduate level.
      </p>
      <p>
	While at K College, the 6-month study abroad program was at JCMU
	(Japan Center for Michigan Universities). Part of the program was
	a self-selected one month project, which I did in the lab
	of Dr. Akira Kojima at the University of Shiga Prefecture. I would
	highly recommend study abroad to anyone. It is one of the best
	ways to understand our colleagues and develop lasting
	networks. Travelling abroad helps us to expand our worlds, and
	maybe even pick up some novel ideas on how to design
	an experiment.

	KACS: Can you please tell us a little about your PhD program at
	Indiana, and your Columbia post-doc work?
      </p>
      <p>
	Dr. Malyutin: At Indiana University I continued to work on
	nanomaterials. I worked on the encapsulation of gold, iron oxide,
	and iron platinum nanoparticles, inside protein shells derived
	from viral capsids. Utilizing light scattering and electron
	microscopy we then can use these systems to study viral
	self-assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
	Additionally, iron oxide nanoparticles have a range of very useful
	properties, one of which is that they are superparamagnetic at
	this scale. Viral capsids have evolved over thousands of years to
	protect their genetic cargo and void hosts defenses. By combining
	the two, we were also exploring biomedical applications.
      </p>
      <p>
	During this work, I became greatly interested in cryo-electron
	microscopy. This interest led me to the lab of Joachim Frank at
	Columbia University. During this time, I've learned and practiced
	cryo-electron microscopy by looking at the structures of the late
	biogenesis complex of the large ribosomal subunit.

	KACS: And how is it now, being Co-Director of Caltech's Cryo EM

      <p>
	Dr. Malyutin: Co-directing the cryo-EM center at Caltech has been
	challenging and exciting. It is particularly enjoyable to train
	students to use the microscopes and see the structures that they
	are able to solve.

	today's high school chemistry students? And any recommendations or
	words of advice to today's and future students for getting the
	most out of their Project SEED experience?
      </p>
      <p>
	Dr. Malyutin: I would certainly recommend participation in
	Project SEED to today's high school chemistry students. I can't
	imagine a better way to spend a summer. It is an incredible way to
	learn more science, develop meaningful and long-lasting
	connections, and improve critical thinking. The one main
	suggestion I would give for participating students is to not be
	afraid to ask questions.

<p>
  Our brief discussion with Dr. Malyutin provided an excellent
  validation of the value of KACS's and area high school students'
  participation in Project SEED.  Thanks Andrey, for helping us with
  this 50th anniversary celebration project.
</p>
<p>
  And looking into the future, the on-going work by current KACS
  Project SEED Director, Dr. Doug Williams, to revitalize KACS
  involvement in the project, is positioning us for many more success
  stories to come. We would like to grow our program for next
  year. Please watch our upcoming communications for invitations to
  participate as mentors and sponsors for Summer 2019 Project SEED
  students in our section. Members who would like to learn more are
  welcome to contact our local Project SEED coordinator,
