      Spring is upon us and chemistry is all around us. Grass comes to
      life, flowers bloom and alas the weeds have their moment in the
      sun. All of this is driven by light from the sun and the
      chemistry of the soil. The rain which falls from the sky is
      slightly acid and this acid reacts with rocks in the soil
      freeing minerals, needed for plant growth. This acid arises from
      many sources.  It used to be that a chief source of acid in rain
      was lightning strikes which produced nitrogen oxides. Today much
      of the acid is manmade coming from a wide variety of sources. In
      addition to acid breaking down rocks, the residues of last
      year's plants are being broken down to release minerals and form
      humus. Even the difficult cellulose eventually yields to
      bacterial and chemical degradation. So go stand in your
      backyard. You are standing on a chemical operation as amazing
      and as interesting as any chemical factory.

<h2>April 19 and 26, 2014 and Illustrated Poem Contest</h2>
<p class="author">By Maren Zanotti and Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  The Kalamazoo Section received 4 entries for the Illustrated Poem
  Contest from 2 high schools in the area (Allegan High School and
  Heritage Christian Academy). One was selected and submitted to the
  National contest for evaluation. Each of the two students, one from
  each school, whose posters were considered winners in the local
  evaluation, was awarded a $15 Jet’s Pizza gift card.

  It was the first Spring-like day on Saturday, April 19, in
  Kalamazoo, MI, so there was a very small number of visitors indoors
  at the Oshtemo branch of the Kalamazoo Public Library for their
  Earth Day program; nevertheless, youngsters and their parents who
  were there did stop to avail themselves of the experiments presented
  by Lydia Hines as well as free copies of ACS materials for Grades
  4-6: copies of <em>Celebrating Chemistry</em> from the past several
  years of CCED, along with this year’s “The Wonder of Water”; another
  “hit” were the stickers and the UV exposure card which everyone was
  glad to be able to use in the bright outdoor sun, in anticipation of
  time at the beach when summer arrives.

      Saturday, April 26th was a gorgeous spring day for the Kalamazoo
      Nature Center’s (KNC) Earth Day Celebration. For the sixth
      consecutive year the Kalamazoo American Chemical Society was able to
      participate in the KNC’s Earth Day festivities. We had a very
      successful turnout with approximately one hundred youngsters
      stopping by the KACS table. We presented a crowd-pleasing color
      chromatography experiment that fit well with this year’s “The
      Wonders of Water” theme and allowed kids to make a chromatography
      flower that they were able to take home as a keepsake. We also
      provided free copies of the <em>ACS Celebrating Chemistry</em>
      handout, which presented great information about the properties of
      water, the importance of water in our environment, and gave
      instructions for chemistry-related, child- friendly water
      demonstrations. As always the KACS table was one of the most popular
      tables at the event!  Several parents and KNC staff members
      complimented us on our exciting demo and informative handouts and as
      always, all of the kids loved making a chromatography flower. The
      KNC educational staff also approached the WMU Chemistry Club to ask
      if we would be interested in participating in other educational
      science demonstrations at the KNC throughout the upcoming year,
      which is a very exciting opportunity!

      Several student volunteers participated in this year’s Chemist
      Celebrate Earth Day celebration. Jager Hartman, Evan Rasor, Casey
      Wright and Maren Zanotti from the Western Michigan University
      Chemistry Club, as well as Katherine Mattison from Kalamazoo College
      were tremendously helpful in making this event a wonderful success!

<p>
  Our annual Kalamazoo Section Award gathering <strong>will be held on
    May 12</strong>, Monday, at 6 pm. Once again, the atrium in the
    Chemistry Building at WMU (between the Waldo Library and Wood
    Hall) will be the place to gather for hors d’oeuvres and informal
    visiting and camaraderie with other members, teachers, and
    students and their parents. This social time will be followed by
    our presentation of awards to our Section’s High school students,
    College students, a High school teacher, certificates to 50-year
    members, and awards to members.  So that we can have enough food
    available we encourage a
  <strong>response ASAP or by May 6</strong> regarding your positive
  participation; send your reply to Mrs. Robin Lenkart either at
