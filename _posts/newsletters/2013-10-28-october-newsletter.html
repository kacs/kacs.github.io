    <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
    <p>
      We began our fall events series with an entertaining and
      instructional Science Café on horticultural chemistry at Wedel’s
      Nursery. For the third year in a row, KACS held a Sci-Mix Poster
      Session at Bell’s Eccentric Café, made possible through the
      generous support by Zoetis. The annual Chemistry Day at the
      Museum occurred much earlier than usual this year. Thanks to our
      councilor Dr. Lydia Hines and event coordinator Annette
      Hoppenworth, we hosted 700 visitors with the help of 87
      volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 1, KACS will offer its final event of the year by
      inviting chemists, the general public, dancers and spectators to
      a Gala Chemistry Dance at the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts. As
      part of the “Chemistry & Culture” series, “Elements of Dance”
      will offer a brief program, refreshments, showcase and open
      dances, puzzles, prizes and lots of fun from 7-10 PM. There will
      be an exhibit titled “Molecular Foundation of Movement” that
      connects atoms and molecules to exercise science. A special
      display will celebrate the life-long contributions of chemist,
      entrepreneur and art collector Dr. Alfred Bader, founder of
      Aldrich Chemicals. In closing, my sincere gratitude goes to all
      the donors who are helping us make this free outreach activity
      possible: AAAS, Aldrich Chemistry, VWR, WMU, WMU-BTR, and last
      but not least Alfred Bader Fine Arts. Feel free to invite your
      friends and neighbors. I hope you can join us.

<h1>Sci-Mix Poster Session at Bell's Eccentric Café</h1>
<p class="author">By Elke Schoffers with Photos by DB Family Photography<p>
<p>
  For the third year in a row, KACS hosted a poster session titled
  "Sustainable Science - Recycle a Poster" at Bell's brewery downtown
  Kalamazoo. Posters were either newly prepared or "recycled" from a
  previous event. Local chemists from industry and academia, including
  graduate and undergraduate students were invited to view 47
  registered poster entries, 28 of them presented by students. There
  were 95 attendees who had a chance to enjoy hot appetizers and beer
  while listening to a presentation by Mayuri Bhakta, a Product
  Development Scientist at Kellogg's. Bhakta received her B.S. in
  Chemistry at Florida A&amp;M University before completing a M.S. degree,
  Florida A&amp;M, in the “Synthesis and Spectroscopic Characterization of
  Differic Model Compounds”. Recently she also completed a Master of
  Business Administration at the University of Florida. In her current
  position she focuses on developing cereal products in the Kids
  Group.  Before and after the keynote speaker, attendees were able to
  mingle, catch up with local scientists and review poster
  contributions based on the work at Bell’s Brewery, Excell IMS Corp.,
  Kalamazoo College, Kalsec, Perrigo, Northwestern University,
  University of Illinois, WMU and Zoetis. Chemist Denis Billen of DB
  Family Photography & DJ Services took the photos shown below;

<h1>Announcements</h1>
<h2>
  Participate in planning the JGLCRM 2015 - A Professional Meeting
  close to home!
</h2>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  The acronym, <b>JGLCRM</b>, stands for Joint Great Lakes-Central
  Regional Meeting!  Our Local Section (in the Great Lakes Region)
  will be co-hosting, along with the Western Michigan Section (in the
  Central Region), that Regional Meeting in Grand Rapids; the dates
  are May 3-6, 2015.  The program is what makes a meeting, so even
  though 2015 may sound like a long time from now, for good planning
  time is of the essence.  I want to thank those who have already
  volunteered for the positions of Program co-chair (James Kiddle),
  Exhibits/Fundraising co-chair (John B. Miller) and Publicity
  co-chair (Elke Schoffers).  This leaves as an immediate need from
  our Section that of Awards co-chair (responsible for our Region’s
  High School Teacher Award, the Nalley Regional Volunteer Award, and
  the Region’s Encouraging-Diversity Award). As planning will likely
  begin in October, we need to have a full complement of co-chairs
  from our Section very soon. To learn more about the responsibilities
  of the <strong>Awards Chair</strong> and to volunteer, please
  contact the 2015 JGLCRM General co-chair Lydia E. M. Hines either by
  <a href="mailto:lemhwgh@gmail.com?subject=Join Regional Meeting">e-mail</a>
  or by telephone at 269-375-7349. I look forward to hearing from you.

<h2>Another Successful Chemistry Day at the Museum</h2>
<h3>What a whirl of activity this year, whose chosen theme was “Energy – Now and Forever”</h3>
<p class="author">By Lydia Bines</p>

<p>
  Students in grades K-12 were invited to submit illustrated poems on
  the theme. Response was received from 2 schools with entries in
  Grades 3-5 and 9-12. These will be submitted to the National
  competition and we await to hear how our entries may fare – maybe we
  can get another national winner, as we did last year.
</p>
<p>
  Celebrating Chemistry, a publication prepared by the ACS for
  youngsters in grades 4-6, was distributed to the Kalamazoo and
  Portage Libraries, the Museum publicized Chemistry Day at the
  Kalamazoo Valley Museum in their quarterly magazine <em>Museon</em>
  and in the <em>Kalamazoo Gazette</em> and flyers were distributed to
  all K-12 teachers for whom we have
  e-addresses.  <em>ChemMatters</em>, a publication prepared by ACS
  for High School students, was distributed to those who came to the
  Museum event.
</p>
<p>
  With the expert, tireless and valuable assistance of Annette
  Hoppenworth 87 volunteers (KACS members and friends) participated in
  our largest outreach effort of the week; we presented 29 hands-on
  activities to about 700 patrons on a beautiful Fall Saturday in our
  southwest corner of Michigan.  It was heartening to welcome 35
  first-time volunteers!  Teachers, parents, scout leaders and
  children left with smiles on their faces, bags full of materials to
  encourage their continued learning at home and/or in the classroom,
  and with a good taste of the excitement of chemistry and science in
  general, as a result of having been encouraged to observe and
  participate in our activities.  A very warm thank you goes to all
  who made this event another successful one for our Section.

<p>
  On September 4, 2013, WMU Chemistry Graduate Student Association
  (CGSA) and the WMU Chem Club hosted an ice cream social for graduate
  and undergraduate students as well as faculty and staff members of
  the Department of Chemistry. It took place in the Commons Area on
  the 3rd floor of the Chemistry Building on WMU’s campus. The goal
  was to introduce new students to the existing student body. A
  concurrent poster session by 25 presenters provided opportunities to
  become familiar with current research projects. With more than 50
  people attending, students were able to make new connections as well
  as to catch up with old friends. This was a successful event, which
  was made possible with financial support from KACS.

<h1>Science Café on Horticultural Chemistry</h1>
<h2>Natural Colors: The Chemistry of Pretty Flowers</h2>
<p class="author">
  By Elke Schoffers and James Guzinski with photos by Roxana
  Manta-Bielanski
</p>

<p>
  On September 17, 2013, there were about 35 visitors in the audience
  of the Science Café, many of them first time participants from the
  general public.  Dr. James A.  (Gus) Guzinski (WMU instructor,
  retired from Kalsec) described the pigments that have been
  identified in the flowers of daylilies. The most common of these are
  carotenoid pigments and anthocyanins.  Carotenoid pigments are fat
  soluble and found throughout the tissues of flowers. On the other
  hand, anthocyanins are found only in the epidermis, the top layer of
  tissue.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-{{ site.device }}-8">
    <p>
      The science of flower coloration is complex because light can be
      absorbed and reflected off different layers of tissue. For
      example, purple anthocyanins with yellow carotenoids will give
      brown colors as light passes through the epidermis and is
      reflected from within the flower. Guzinski also described the
      complex chemistry needed to produce a blue flower. Blue pigments
      require multiple genes working together to produce relevant
      structures from anthocyanidins, sugars, fatty acids and, often,
      metal ions in very specific 3D arrangements. This complexity is
      the reason that genetic engineering attempts to produce blue
      roses and blue carnations has failed thus far. Too few genes
      could be manipulated at the same time.

<p>
  The event took place in the flower shop of Wedel’s Nursery, Florist
  & Garden Center. Attendees enjoyed appetizers and snacks provided by
  Off-the Cuff Catering. Door prizes included perennial flowers, gold
  elemental pins and nano moles. Guzinski spent twenty years
  researching natural colors and flavors at a local company, the
  Kalamazoo Spice Extraction Company.  He is author of several patents
  on hop products that are employed as flavors in the brewing
  industry. Since his retirement from his position as Senior Chemist,
  he has been teaching part-time at Western Michigan University. He
  also hybridizes daylilies with the goal of producing new colors in
  flowers and a particular interest in extending the bloom season.
