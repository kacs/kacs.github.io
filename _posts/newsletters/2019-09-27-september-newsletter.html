<h1 id="national-chemistry-week">Celebrate National Chemistry Week
2019 Chemistry Day at the Museum</h1>

<h2>33<sup>rd</sup> Chemistry Day at the Museum</h2>

<h3>Hands-on activities and resources for all ages!</h3>

<p>
  Saturday, October 12 | 12:00 &ndash; 16:00<br />
  Kalamazoo Valley Museum<br />
  230 N. Rose St., Kalamazoo<br />
  FREE!<br />
</p>
<p>
  Co-sponsored by the <a href="/">Kalamazoo Section of the American
    Chemical Society</a> and
    the <a href="https://kalamazoomuseum.org/" title="KVM homepage.">Kalamazoo Valley Museum</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This year's <i>Chemistry Day at the Museum</i> is scheduled for
  <b>Saturday, October 12<sup>th</sup>, from noon to 4 pm at the
  Kalamazoo Valley Museum</b>. This is the Kalamazoo Section of the
  American Chemical Society (KACS) community outreach event for
  National Chemistry Week (museum notice attached). This very popular
  public event typically attracts 600 to 1000 people and <b>we need
  volunteers to run demos</b> that are appropriate for young children
  (K through 8 th grade). Please let me
  or <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia Hines</a> know as soon as
  possible if you are willing to participate in this event. Visitors
  to the event are always excited to see new demos. We also have a
  list of activities that have been presented in the past if you are
  looking for ideas to present.
</p>
<p>
  The 2019 National Chemistry Week theme is <i>Marvelous Metals</i>
  but all age and location appropriate activities which introduce
  children to science concepts are welcome. A major goal of events
  like these is to introduce our visitors to scientific concepts and
  therefore all presenters need to model appropriate lab safety
  (safety glasses and/or lab coats, shields, etc.) even if using
  commonly-available materials (chemicals) and visitors need to be
  alerted to the importance of safety even if materials being used in
  a hands-on demonstration may be items found in the kitchen; the one
  PPE item they MUST wear is safety goggles, which we provide on
  entry.
</p>
<p>
  With enough advance notice the Kalamazoo Valley Museum assists with
  purchasing common supplies (things that can be bought at Walmart,
  Meijer’s, Amazon, etc.) for demos, but specialty items must be
  provided by the presenters (glassware, chemicals, etc.)
<p>
  Please share this article with others that might have an interest in
  assisting or attending this very popular KACS outreach event. We
  appreciate your consideration to volunteer your time in support of
  this event. This event is free of charge and open to the public, so
  please consider attending even if you are not able to help with
  presenting a demo this year.

      Chemistry plays essential roles in understanding biology and
      creating new ways to combat human diseases. Ben Swarts, an
      Associate Professor at Central Michigan University, will
      discuss how chemical biology&ndash;the use of synthetic small
      molecules to study and manipulate biological systems&ndash;has
      been used in his research to explore novel approaches to
      diagnosing and treating the devastating bacterial disease
      tuberculosis. This story spans nearly two decades, ranging
      from Ben’s early experiences as an undergraduate chemistry
      major, through his time studying as a postdoc in South Africa,
      and to his current work as a chemistry professor and director
      of a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) tuberculosis research facility. It
      is hoped that this talk will illustrate how a passion for
      chemistry and a bit of serendipity can crystallize into an
      exciting, fruitful, and sometimes unpredictable career in the
      chemical sciences.
