      I want to begin my time as chair of the Kalamazoo Section by
      thanking everyone who volunteered at and attended our events
      over the last year. As a testament to the hard work that goes
      into the events that we host, we were rewarded with two
      ChemLuminary awards this year, one for our innovative Chemistry
      and Culture series, and the second for our Recycle-a-Poster
      event that is fast becoming a yearly tradition (Please see the
      September 2014 Newsletter for more detail). We couldn't have
      achieved these honors without your efforts and dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year is looking to be just as busy for the Kalamazoo
      Section. Our first large event will be the Joint Great
      Lakes/Central Regional ACS Meeting that we are co-hosting with
      the West Michigan Section this May 27-30 at DeVos Place in Grand
      Rapids. Dr. Scott Denmark (University of Illinois at
      Urbana-Champaign) will kick off the meeting as the opening
      plenary speaker, and Dr. Joan Brennecke (University of Notre
      Dame) and Dr. Dustin Mergott (Eli Lilly) will continue the
      high-level technical proceedings on Wednesday and Thursday
      afternoon.

  Our annual awards gathering is coming up this spring, followed
  by a meeting we are planning with the Detroit and Huron Valley
  Sections in Ann Arbor this September. Chemistry Day at the
  Kalamazoo Valley Museum, a favorite event for both our section
  and me, will be in October, and planning for this year's
  Recycle-a-Poster event is already underway for November.
</p>
<p>
  I would enjoy hearing from you about what events you've enjoyed
  in the past, and what events you'd like to see in the future,
  and I look forward to working with you this year.

  Americans love sweets. Not only do we consume large quantities of
  sugar, mostly derived from sugar cane and sugar beets, we consume
  large amounts of artificial sweeteners. The oldest artificial
  sweetener is saccharin which was discovered in 1878 by Constantin
  Fahlberg at Johns Hopkins University. At first its use in food was
  banned. Later, its use in foods was allowed although it suffered
  repeated bans in response to rat studies which seemed to suggest
  that it might be a carcinogen.  These rat studies were controversial
  because they provided doses far in excess of actual human use of the
  product.
</p>
<p>
  Sugar shortages in WWI and WWII helped promote the use of
  saccharin. In 1958, sodium cyclamate was introduced to the
  market. It was marketed as a mixture of 10 parts cyclamate and 1
  part saccharin. Cyclamate also proved controversial because the ever
  popular rat studies indicated a possible link to cancer. Eventually
  other artificial sweeteners such as Aspartame, Neotame, Acesulfame
  potassium, and Advantame were developed. No artificial sweetener is
  perfect and it seems likely that the development of new non-caloric
  sweeteners will continue for the foreseeable future.

  One of the newer sugar substitutes is sucralose. It was approved for
  US use in 1998 and recently has become quite popular. It is a
  chlorinated sucrose
  (1,6-Dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-&beta;-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-&alpha;-D-galactopyranoside). Sucralose
  is heat stable and may be used in baking. Since the bulking agents
  mixed with the sucralose do not have the same bulking
  characteristics as sucrose, the texture of the baked goods produced
  with sucralose may be different from those produced with
  sugar. However, food manufacturers value sucralose because it is the
  most heat stable artificial sweetener.
</p>
<p>
  The latest sweetener, Advantame, was approved this spring. It is
  20,000 times as sweet as sucrose. It is chemically similar to
  aspartame and is stable at higher temperatures.
</p>
<p>
  Considering Americans' love for sweets, and their desire to avoid
  calories, continuing development of artificial sweeteners seems
  inevitable.
