      Dihydrogen monoxide. The presence of this relatively simple
      chemical in liquid form is essential for the existence of life as we
      know it. It also provides major recreation as rivers, lakes and
      oceans (preferably with beaches). However, as Hurricane Harvey
      reminded us, it can also cause loss of life and severe destruction.
      This tragic event demonstrates in classic form that all chemicals
      can be both beneficial and harmful, depending on factors like
      concentration, degree of reactivity and application. It reinforces
      the important need for chemists, maybe now more than ever, to help
      us understand how to maximize the benefits of all chemicals and
      chemical products, while minimizing their potential for doing harm.
      Our deepest condolences and hopes for successful recovery go out to
      the victims of Hurricane Harvey. A number of relief websites are
      available for donations (the Google donation site will match funds).

      Locally, a number of KACS members spent part of this summer
      learning about the ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark
      program. This is an interesting ACS program that recognizes
      historic chemistry-related achievements, mainly via installation
      of a bronze plaque (similar to the roadside historic event markers
      seen across the country). Eighty-some landmarks have been granted
      since the program began in 1993.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read about the program and the
      landmarks <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In thinking about this program and the notable history of
      chemistry in Kalamazoo, some of us decided to put together a
      nomination team and package, which was submitted to ACS in August.
      The subject of the proposed landmark is: Steroids and Upjohn - a
      Profile of Innovation. A short narrative provided as part of the
      nomination package is included in this month's newsletter. It
      really is an excellent story, describing work very worthy of
      historic landmark designation. Thanks to the nomination team: Tom
      Runge, Bill Kovats, John Manski, Ken Ball and Jeremy Winkworth.
      We hope to hear back from ACS soon regarding our nomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heading into fall now, a number of KACS activities are coming up
      with opportunities for involvement, information about which is
      provided in this newsletter. Read about the need for members to
      help John Stodola with a project, to be mentors for a
      speed-networking event, and to volunteer to help with the National
      Chemistry Week Museum Day. Also included in this newsletter is
      the first call for nominations for open 2018 KACS Officer
      positions. And welcome to Bill Schinzer, joining the KACS
      Executive Committee as Treasurer. There are plenty of
      opportunities to get involved with the KACS local section, to get
      the most out of our ACS membership, why not choose one and join
      in.

      Bill Schinzer will be taking over the KACS Treasurer duties as
      Andre Venter begins his sabbatical in Paris this month. Bill earned
      his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Indiana University and worked
      for the Upjohn Company and its successor companies of years past.
      He worked with analytical R&amp;D groups, developing methods and
      solving interesting problems for both drug product and drug
      substance support. Bill is a veteran of several Boy Scout Chemistry
      Merit Badge days. In 2006 he started work for Eurofins, a small
      contract research organization in Portage, serving as their Director
      of Method Development. In late 2010 he started his own firm, Arrow
      Pharma Services LLC. He currently works with large pharmaceutical
      firms as well as startups developing new drugs, generally helping
      them solve chemistry and pharmaceutics problems. Bill and his wife,
      Martie, live in Portage and enjoy driving along in their 1974 VW
      Bus. Their children, Eric and Chris, are not as fond of the bus,
      perhaps because it used to honk its own horn occasionally.

<h1 id="p3-award">P3 Award Winner</h1>

Our Kalamazoo Section was the recipient of the P3 (Partnership for
Progress and Prosperity Award) at the 2017 Great Lakes Regional
Meeting in Fargo, North Dakota, for our *Sustainable Science - Recycle
a Poster* activity each November. What impressed the selection
committee specifically were (a) the opportunity afforded by this event
to bring science into the public eye since the event is open to all,
(b) the benefit of connecting future scientists with today's
professionals through networking in an informal setting, and (c) the
fact that the event provides a forum for posters to be given a "second
lease on life", thus reinforcing the theme of sustainability - i.e.,
they are presented after having already been presented at other
conferences. We appreciate the effort made by Elke Schoffers to submit
our nomination. The Award consists of a medallion and a framed
certificate for each of the three partners in the award (in our case
the KACS, Zoetis and Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute;) as well as a cash
award of $333 for each. The Award ceremony was on June 29 and Lydia
Hines was present to receive the award in the Section's behalf.

<h1 id="speed-networking">Speed Networking Event</h1>

Local American Chemical Society (KACS) members and students interested
in Chemistry are invited to attend a fun and interactive networking
event. Co-hosted by the Center for Career and Professional
Development, Kalamazoo College Chemistry Department and the American
Chemical Society Kalamazoo Chapter.

The premise for this event is to connect local chemistry college
students (WMU, K Col, KVCC) with local working chemists for
information sharing. The set up will be like that for speed dating,
with participating chem students rotating through 5 minute (or so) sit
downs with participating working chemists, the students asking
questions related to chem careers, the working chemists providing
answers/information based on personal experience. KACS has been asked
to provide members to serve as a diverse working chemist panel. This
is a great, painless, low time commitment opportunity for us to share
our knowledge and experience with chem university students looking to
start their careers.

Whether you are a potential mentor (experienced individual who can
advise &amp; guide on potential career paths) OR a student interested in
meeting with chemistry professionals, please join us for this
gathering!

<h1 id="chemical-landmark">Our Historic Chemical Landmark Nomination</h1>

<h2>Steroids and Upjohn: A Profile of Chemical Innovation</h2>

<p>
  By the end of the 1940's various steroid compounds of the androgen,
  estrogen, progestogen and adrenocortical classes had been isolated
  from animal tissues, structurally characterized, and studied for
  medicinal properties. As the decade closed out a chemistry
  breakthrough discovery that stood out was Russell Marker working out
  chemical synthesis of progesterone from diosgenin extracted from
  Mexican yams, obviating the need for animal tissues. On the medical
  front, a major breakthrough that shone through was the discovery by
  Mayo Clinic researchers that the corticosteroids like cortisone were
  effective as anti-inflammatories treating the debilitations of
  diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
</p>
<p>
  At the dawning of the 1950's an overwhelming demand for cortisone
  arose. However, cortisone was still being manufactured almost
  entirely as an extract from animal adrenal glands, making the supply
  very low and the cost very high. Merck had a synthetic process for
  manufacture of cortisone, but the process involved over 30 chemical
  steps, a complexity that also limited supply and came with a high
  cost. Other attempts at synthesizing cortisone had hit dead
  ends. Percy Julian was able to synthesize the related compound
  Reichstein's Compound S, but could not find a way to carry out a key
  oxygenation step needed to carry the process all the way to
  cortisone. Similarly, Russell Marker could not find a way to
  oxygenate progesterone to convert it to cortisone (Carl Djerassi
  following up on Marker's work did work out a chemical process for
  converting progesterone to cortisone, but the process was too
  complex to be commercially feasible).
</p>
<p>
  Concurrent with the growing cortisone demand and lack of supply, The
  Upjohn Company was in the midst of a head first plunge into the sea
  of steroid chemistry. The company had been working with steroids
  during the 1930's and 1940's, the work of scientists George Cartland
  and Marvin Kuizenga being most sited during that period. The two
  developed processes for extraction of steroid fractions from animal
  adrenal glands (marketed as a product named ACE), and invented an
  analytical unit for adrenal hormone potency, the Cartland-Kuizenga
  Unit, becoming the worldwide standard. In the mid-1940's in a bold
  future-looking move, The Upjohn Company took on expansion of their
  R&amp;D organization, creating interdisciplinary steroid discovery
  and development teams consisting of chemists, biochemists,
  microbiologists, engineers and production managers. The company also
  expanded their fermentation and chemical synthesis manufacturing
  facilities targeting the ability to manufacture steroid medicines
  with a volume capacity well in excess of expected demand. When the
  new unmet need appeared in 1949-1950 then, for chemical synthesis
  and mass production of cortisone, The Upjohn Company was in position
  to take on the challenge.
</p>
<p>
  Due to this unprecedented focus on steroid chemistry, positive
  results were achieved relatively quickly. In 1950 the Upjohn R&amp;D
  team led by Herbert Murray (a microbiologist) and Durey Peterson (a
  biochemist) discovered that a type of fungus that could be grown in
  fermenters could efficiently do the steroid chemistry that had been
  elusive to lab chemists around the world, selectively oxygenate
  progesterone to hydroxy-progesterone, which could be chemically
  converted to hydrocortisone and cortisone. This was a major
  chemistry breakthrough of the time. In addition to opening the door
  to a relatively simple, inexpensive and commercially scalable
  synthesis of cortisone, the discovery brought to life the chemistry
  of steroid microbiological transformations, and more generally the
  use of fungi (as an addition to bacteria) for chemical
  transformations. The team's success was also a testament to the
  strategy of using multi-disciplinary R&amp;D teams, a practice that
  became standard for all pharmaceutical companies.
</p>
<p>
  At almost the same time, a second Upjohn R&amp;D team led by Haines
  discovered a bacterium that could selectively oxidized Julian's
  Reichstein's Compound S directly to hydrocortisone. This second
  major discovery confirmed the importance of using microbial
  transformations for performing complex steroid chemistry like
  selective oxidations. The discovery also meant that Upjohn had the
  option of having two potential synthesis routes to make
  cortisone. The progesterone route was selected to take forward based
  on expect availability and cost of materials.
</p>
<p>
  From here, Upjohn chemists took the hydroxy-progesterone obtained
  from the microbial transformation of progesterone, and developed an
  elegant five step synthesis to end up with hydrocortisone, which in
  one additional step could be converted to cortisone. The process was
  refined, scale-up and moved to production, and by 1953 Upjohn was
  marketing low-cost, high- quality cortisone (Cortef) and
  hydrocortisone (Neocortef) products, which were very well received.
</p>
<p>
  This alone would be a very good ending to a historic chemistry
  story, a team of scientists in the early 1950's apply a newly
  discovered mix of synthetic chemistry and microbiological
  biochemistry to bring a much needed medicine to patients in
  need. But what makes this story worthy of historic chemical landmark
  designation is that even more chemistry breakthroughs followed.
</p>
<p>
  Having a process in hand for making cortisone from progesterone,
  Upjohn focused on the source of progesterone. In 1953, the
  progesterone was being supplied by Russell Marker's company Syntex,
  and was synthesized from diosgenin extracted from Mexican
  yams. Upjohn chemists Milton Herr, Heyl, Centolella and team had
  developed process for a four-step converting stigmasterol from
  soybeans to progesterone in 1950, and by 1955 they had refined the
  process so that Upjohn was able to start making its own
  progesterone. Soon stigmasterol from soy replaced diosgenin from
  Mexican yam as the primary plant-based starting material for steroid
  synthesis being conducted by most pharmaceutical companies.
</p>
<p>
  To go with the switch to stigmasterol as a starting material, Upjohn
  scientist J. Ward Greiner and team developed an innovative leaching
  and counter-current process for recovering stigmasterol from the soy
  sterol mix produced as a by-product of soybean food processing,
  truly becoming a classic example of using a sustainable source for a
  chemical starting material. Greiner's process for recovery of
  stigmasterol also recovered as a by-product, the related compound
  sitosterol. The chemistry for utilizing sitosterol as a starting
  material for steroid synthesis was not understood at the time, but
  rather than discarding the sitosterol byproduct, the company in a
  conservationist move starting stockpiling the very stable, water
  insoluble sitosterol. This stockpile grew for over ten years until a
  use was found for it.
</p>
<p>
  During the late 1950's with corticosteroid production well in hand,
  the Upjohn scientists turned research toward discovery of next
  generation analogs of cortisone. Using the established approach of
  combining synthetic chemistry and microbial biochemistry, a number
  of new compounds were discovered and marketed, including
  prednisolone, methyl-prednisolone (Medrol), fluoroprednisolone
  (Alphadrol) and Oxylone, which showed for various anti- inflammation
  indications, better efficacy and safety profiles than did
  cortisone. Keeping manufacturing needs in mind, the chemistry
  processes developed used whenever possible, intermediate compounds
  from the main line cortisone process, a strategy, the use of common
  intermediates, that became standard for the pharmaceutical
  industry. The next generation discovery work also branched to
  include discovery of progesterone analogs including
  acetoxyprogesterone and melengesterol acetate for contraception
  applications in the veterinary area, and medroxyprogesterone acetate
  (Provera) as a human contraceptive. As Motown became Hitsville USA
  in the music world, Kalamazoo also in Michigan, became Hitsville USA
  in the steroid medicine world due to Upjohn's long-term innovative
  approach to medicinal chemistry and manufacture.
</p>
<p>
  Then in the 1970's already having a rapidly growing steroid medicine
  portfolio, another major microbiological transformation discovery
  was made. Upjohn scientist Merle Wovcha and team discovered a
  bacterium that selectively transformed sitosterol into a compound
  (hydroxyandrostendione), which could with additional slight chemical
  modification be plugged into the main line manufacturing processes
  for existing products. With this breakthrough the sitosterol
  stockpile that had been growing for over ten years as a byproduct of
  stigmasterol recovery from soy sterols, became a valuable starting
  material in its own right. With this discovery Upjohn was now not
  only sourcing starting materials from a sustainable source, it had
  found a way to utilize multiple materials from a single source,
  sustainability and conservation practices that were to become key
  principles of green chemistry. The discovery also opened up a whole
  new area for chemical exploration involving androstenedione
  compounds, including the application of novel silicon (SNAP)
  chemistry.
</p>
<p>
  During the 1980's the work continued including the discovery of
  additional analogs and new sterol starting material sources, and
  improving production synthetic chemistry and microbiology
  biochemical step efficiencies and costs. By 1990, having strung
  together an unparalleled series of chemistry and manufacturing
  discoveries and developments, Upjohn had become the premier steroid
  medicine producer in the world. The company had a portfolio of over
  30 medicinal steroid products and supplied steroid intermediates to
  a number of other pharmaceutical companies for synthesis of
  additional steroid medicines.
</p>
<p>
  The significance of this chemical landmark achievement continues to
  be felt today. The Kalamazoo production facility, now as part of
  Pfizer Inc. continues today manufacturing steroid medicines and
  intermediates for global markets. The Kalamazoo steroid
  manufacturing site was lauded in a 2017 Investor's Business Daily
  article as an example of how U.S. manufacturing can be made
  efficient and low cost enough to compete in today's global
  economy. This is a testament to the historic importance of The
  Upjohn Company's 1950-1990 steroid chemistry work.
