<h1 id="el-sol-elementary">KACS at El Sol Elementary</h1>
<p>
  Once again this spring, KACS was a sponsor and worked a display
  table for the 2nd annual <em>Kalamazoo Earth Day Festival</em> in
  Bronson Park. We showed Kalamazoo how glucose can sometimes be used
  as a green chem reagent for doing reduction reactions, and had a lot
  of fun working with indigo carmine as a very visual, reversible pH
  and redox indicator.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Many thanks</strong> to the KACS members who worked our
  table: Luke Chadwick, Greg Johnson, Tom Runge, Steve Secreast and
  Doug Williams.

<h1 id="kalamazoo-marathon">KACS at the Kalamazoo Marathon</h1>
<p>
  On May 6, 2018 KACS worked the Kalamazoo Marathon 15 mile-marker
  water stop. A fun time was had by all, passing high-quality
  H<sub>2</sub>O to the runners from our chemistry- themed water stop.
</p>
<p>
  We were <strong>happy to cheer on Evan Williams</strong>, son of
  KACS Alternate Councilor Doug Williams, as Evan sped past our water
  stop on his way to winning the marathon for the second year in a
  row. According to the race website, <strong>424 runners finished the
  marathon</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks to the intrepid KACS water stop crew: Jeff Bartz, Cathy
  Ervin, Anthony Ervin, Kim Lewis, Tom Mulhern, Margarita Pinto, Elke
  Schoffers, Steve Secreast, Susan Sheehan, Denis Sobieray, John
  Stodola, Kristi Tullis, Mike Walsh, and Jenny (Kristi's friend).

<h1 id="kpl">KACS Salutes KPL</h1>
<p>
  If you are a pre-school or elementary school aged person (or have
  kids or grandkids that age), and you've spent time at
  the <em>Kalamazoo Public Library</em> (KPL), chances are you've
  heard of <strong>Little Scientists</strong>, <strong>Super
  Science</strong>, <strong>Slime Works</strong>, <strong>Chemical
  Kim</strong> and/or <strong>Science Flix</strong>. These
  science-based programs are part of what makes KPL such an asset to
  Kalamazoo.
</p>
<p>
  To recognize these programs and the additional outstanding
  STEM-related work of the KPL staff, KACS awarded KPL an
  ACS <em>Salutes to Excellence</em> Award. Salutes to Excellence is
  an ACS recognition award given to underscore outstanding
  accomplishments, achievements or service for individuals and groups
  who have made a positive impact on everyday life. Honorees may be
  practitioners of chemistry, products of chemistry or places of
  importance in chemistry within our community. And KPL most
  definitely is a place of community importance.
</p>
<p>
  The Salutes to Excellence Award was presented to Susan Warner, Head
  of the KPL Youth Services Department, at the 7 May Annual KACS Award
  Night.

<h1 id="cgsa-picnic">KACS at the CGSA Picnic</h1>

<p>
  On May 10, 2018 the Chemistry Graduate Student Association (CGSA)
  hosted a spring picnic for the undergraduate and graduate students,
  faculty and staff of the Department of Chemistry, and KACS
  members. The aim of this event was to encourage socializing and
  networking within the WMU Chemistry Department and community
  members. With about 40 people attending, students were able to make
  new connections, as well as catch up with old friends. Thank you
  KACS for joining us for this event.
</p>
<p>
  We hope to see you next year!

<h1 id="awards-gathering">KACS at the Annual Awards Gathering</h1>

<p>
  The young people were present in fine attire on a lovely May Monday
  afternoon in the foyer of the Chemistry Building on the WMU campus,
  along with teachers, friends and/or parents, to receive awards based
  on achievements in their chemistry studies.
</p>
<p>
  It was our section's 45th annual Awards Gathering where we recognize
  high school students and teachers, as well as college students,
  section members who have served the American Chemical Society for
  many years, and others in the community and of our membership whose
  contributions have been noteworthy.  This year for the first time we
  also recognized our Project SEED student, Victor Plascencia
  (Comstock HS), and Kalamazoo College's Dr. Dwight Williams, his
  mentor over the 10-week summer research program,
</p>
<p>
  Though none of our six long-time members (1-50 years, 2-60 years,
  1-70 years, and 2-76 years) was able to be with us, our councilor,
  Lydia E. M. Hines, did present a recognition certificate to
  Dr. Donald Iffland at his home that afternoon; a retiree from the
  WMU Chemistry Department he served as Section chairman in 1967 and
  1968.  Our member volunteer for his able and willing service for
  many years was Dr. James Kiddle.  This year we also gave awards to
  two of our Section's HS teachers for their many years of instilling
  enthusiasm for chemistry in their students â€“ Mr. Brad Portis at Gull
  Lake HS and Mrs. Doreen Odziana at Paw Paw HS. A separate short
  description is given in a separate article regarding the
  Salute-to-Excellence award given to the Kalamazoo Public Library's
  representative Susan Warner.
