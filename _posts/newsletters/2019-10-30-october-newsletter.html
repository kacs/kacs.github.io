<h1 id="kvcc-award">Congratulations to KACS Member Charissa Oliphant</h1>
<h2>KVCC 2019 Faculty Instruction Award winner</h2>
<p>
  The KVCC 2019 Instructional Award recipients were announced in the
  September 2019 edition of KV Focus, the Kalamazoo Valley Community
  College newsletter. The awards are designed to reward those
  instructors at Kalamazoo Valley who actively encourage students’
  intellectual curiosity, engage them in the enterprise of learning,
  and have a lifelong impact. Current students, faculty and staff may
  nominate for the recognition.
</p>
<p>
  Congratulations go out to 2019 Award recipient, KVCC Chemistry
  Instructor and KACS member, <strong>Charissa Oliphant</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  A student said this about Charissa:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Mrs. O. has been a phenomenal instructor. I was not excited about
  having to take chemistry and she has made the class so accessible
  and as easy to understand as possible. She actively works to make
  sure her students are informed about all the opportunities available
  to them for both learning and professional development. She is
  extremely patient with questions and is always willing to spare the
  extra time to help a student having trouble with a problem or
  concept”
</blockquote>
<p>Another nominator said, </p>
<blockquote>
  Mrs. Oliphant helped create my love for chemistry. She is a great
  instructor and really cares about her students. She is very
  organized and puts her students in a position to succeed. Chemistry
  isn’t the easiest class, but she was always willing to help and
  ensure her students were prepared. I would recommend her to anyone
  taking chemistry. She is a great instructor who explains everything
  clearly and is so helpful.
</blockquote>
<p>
  In addition to teaching chemistry at KVCC, Charissa has been a
  long-term active member of KACS. She received the Local Section
  Award for Meritorious Service in 2014. Her service continues today
  with her participation in KACS events like the Speed Networking
  Event for local college students, where she has been serving as a
  mentor.
</p>
<p>
  Great work, very well done Charissa. You are a KACS hero.

    <h3>From Lipid Probes to Tuberculosis Drugs:
      Two Decades of Chemical Biology Research</h3>
    <p class="author">
      by Prof. Benjamin Swarts<br />
      Associate Professor<br />
      Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Central Michigan University
    </p>

    <p>
      Chemistry plays essential roles in understanding biology and
      creating new ways to combat human diseases. Ben Swarts, an
      Associate Professor at Central Michigan University, will
      discuss how chemical biology—the use of synthetic small
      molecules to study and manipulate biological systems—has
      been used in his research to explore novel approaches to
      diagnosing and treating the devastating bacterial disease
      tuberculosis. This story spans nearly two decades, ranging
      from Ben’s early experiences as an undergraduate chemistry
      major, through his time studying as a postdoc in South Africa,
      and to his current work as a chemistry professor and director
      of a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) tuberculosis research facility. It
      is hoped that this talk will illustrate how a passion for
      chemistry and a bit of serendipity can crystallize into an
      exciting, fruitful, and sometimes unpredictable career in the
      chemical sciences.

      We are off and running with our IYPT celebrations in the
      Kalamazoo Local Section. About 30 ACS members and supporters
      joined us at One Well Brewing on Mon, Oct 21 for a Dine to
      Donate event to raise funds for Project SEED. We raised over $50
      for Project SEED and had a great time. Check out our local IYPT
      <a href="https://kalamazooiypt.wordpress.com/" title="IYPT event

      will have a chance to meet our Summer 2019 Project SEED fellows
      as they present their research results during the poster
      session. If you would like to make a direct donation to our
      local Project SEED fund, please go our

      On October 12<sup>th</sup>, 2018 the 33<sup>rd</sup> Annual
      Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum drew 550 patrons for an
      early celebration of National Chemistry Week. Approximately 60
      volunteers presented 15 hands-on activities to the attendees.  The
      theme of 2019's National Chemistry Week is <em>Marvelous Metals</em>, and
      volunteers did a great job showcasing the theme with activities
      including a penny demo that heated a zinc coated penny to form
      brass, shiny pennies, using metals to clean up oil spills, magnets,
      metal detectors, and iron in cereal. At another table, members
      shared the significance of Kalamazoo's designation earlier this year
      as a National Historic Chemical Landmark for the development of
      steroid medicines at the Upjohn Company.

      KACS Volunteers from the Air Zoo, Kalamazoo Valley Museum,
      Pfizer, Perrigo, Kalsec, Kalexsyn, Western Michigan University,
      and Kalamazoo College, graciously volunteered their time to
      share these and other activities with the Kalamazoo community. A
      big THANK YOU to everyone that worked so hard to make this event
      a huge success. It is hard to describe the joy one experiences
      seeing the smile on young children’s faces as they begin to
      understand the concepts behind these demonstrations. Hopefully
      some of these curious young attendees will remember this
      positive event when deciding a college major 5 to 10 years from
      now and choose the chemical sciences.

  <strong>Anyone willing to present a demo</strong> at the Museum Day
  event in early November 2020 send me an email
  (hjude[at]kalsec[dot]com) and I will stay in touch as next year's
  event approaches. The theme of 2020's National Chemistry week
  is <em>Sticking with Chemistry</em> (Glues and Adhesives).
