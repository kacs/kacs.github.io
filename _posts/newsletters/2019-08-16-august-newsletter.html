    <h3>Introducing Our 2019 Project SEED Fellows</h3>
    <p class="author">By Doug Williams, Kalamazoo ACS Project SEED Coordinator</p>
    <p>
      Dear Local Section Members, I am delighted to introduce you to
      our current Project SEED Fellows.  Project SEED provides summer
      research experiences in chemistry for high school students from
      low income households. This has been a powerful program. Over
      11,000 students have participated, and ACS Assessments show that
      it has had a strong impact on the academic and career pathways
      of those students. The Kalamazoo local section has sponsored 75
      student projects in the last 25 years.  Each Project SEED
      fellowship costs our local section about $2000 after matching
      funds from ACS. Your donations to national or local section
      Project SEED programs are vital to the success of the program.
      Donations to our local section funds are allocated entirely for
      local student stipends.  Please <a href="/people/williams.html"
      title="Doug Williams contact info">contact me</a> if you would
      like to learn more about supporting us.  You have an opportunity
      to meet both of our Project SEED fellows in person and hear
      about their work at a summer research symposium in the Kalamazoo
      College Dow Science Center from 11am &ndash; 2pm on Friday, Aug
      23.  Please join us if you are interested and available.

<h3>Yanari Raines</h3>
<p class="author">By Yanari Raines</p>
<p>
  I am a rising senior at Kalamazoo Central High School and I will be
  graduating in June of 2020. My current interests and hobbies are
  running both cross country and track, starting my internship through
  my law enforcement EFE, and volunteering. My current plans after
  high school, however, are to start my path to becoming a Unites
  States Marine. I will be attending an NROTC college in the South and
  training to become an officer in the summer. And even though my
  career path does not correlate directly with chemistry I still have
  the chance to major in any subject I want. Therefore, after being a
  part of Project SEED I will definitely consider majoring in the
  sciences. I learned about this opportunity through my high school
  chemistry teacher, Dr. Chartanay Bonner. At first, I was not sure
  about applying because I didn’t have much science experience (only
  biology and honors chemistry), but soon that became the exact reason
  why I wanted to. My Project SEED mentor is Dr. Kelly Teske (WMU
  Chemistry) and our project is focused on developing analogues of
  2-4-diphenylquinazoline. However, our goal is to manipulate this
  small molecule to globally upregulate tumor suppressive miRNA in
  breast cancer. What I appreciate about this project so far is how
  hands on it is compared to high school classes, the challenge it
  brings with its advanced information, and the one on one teaching. I
  am the only Project SEED fellow at WMU this year but I think it is
  helpful to schedule periodic meetings with other Project SEED
  fellows throughout the summer. Even though we have different
  projects I can say from experience that we struggle the same. We
  both know it’s one thing to be the youngest student in a lab, but to
  know next to nothing about organic chemistry is even harder. To
  future Project SEED fellows, I recommend that you stay focused, open
  minded, and positive. But you also have to be patient, (especially
  if you ever run a preparative chromatography column). Just
  understand that organic chemistry is probably one of the hardest
  subjects you will ever encounter, so ask questions! And remember, no
  one expects you to come in as a chemical genius, but I promise with
  time you will fit right in.

<h3>Riannat Sanusi</h3>
<p class="author">By Doug Williams</p>
<p>
  Riannat is a rising junior at Kalamazoo Central High School, who
  plans to graduate in June 2021. She came to the US about four years
  ago with her family from Nigeria, where her mom ran her own food
  business and Riannat began to learn some agricultural science.
  Riannat continues to be interested in math and science and plans to
  take advanced chemistry this fall.  She is not sure of her study
  plans beyond high school but is presently hoping to attend Univ. of
  Michigan or Michigan State Univ. Riannat was also a member of the
  KCHS Mock Trial Team that won its 21st Michigan State Championship
  and competed in May in Athens, GA at the Nationals.  Riannat learned
  about Project SEED from her high school chemistry teacher,
  Dr. Chartanay Bonner. Her Project SEED mentor is Dr. Dwight Williams
  (Kalamazoo Chemistry).  She is working on the synthesis of novel
  non-nitrogenous serotonin receptor ligands based upon the
  2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone scaffold. Her work builds upon the work of
  previous Project SEED students Victor Plascencia (2017) and Daniel
  Calco (2018) in the Dr. Williams group at K-College.

  improve their science outreach skills and fully maximize Society
  resources for planning hands-on science events. In-person workshops
  will be offered at two regional meetings (NERM and SERMACS). If you
  can't attend the training in person, register now for the
  seven-webinar series offered through the <a href="https://learning.acs.org/">ACS Learning Management
    System</a>.
</p>

  The program includes sessions on the history of ACS Outreach, safety
  in outreach settings, event planning and fundraising, communicating
  through hands-on activities, marketing and partnerships, leading
  volunteers, and monitoring success. Attendees will learn to
  successfully plan and execute hands-on science outreach events, as
  well as have an opportunity to network and build a community with
  others who are passionate about science outreach and ACS. For more
  information, click above to register, visit the <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/outreach-training-program.html?sc=190607_outreach_news_acsmters_otp">OTP web page</a> or
