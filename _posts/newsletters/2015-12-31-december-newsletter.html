      This was a busy year for our Kalamazoo Local Section. We started
      off the spring with our annual High School Competitive Exam and
      subsequent Awards Gathering. We honored our 50- and 60-year
      members, and gave awards to Outstanding Students from local High
      Schools and from WMU and K College.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also gave awards to the High School students who placed in
      our annual competitive exam. I was surprised by the number of
      sophomore and junior students who have the opportunity to
      compete again in 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May, we co-hosted the 2015 Joint Great Lakes / Central
      Regional Meeting in Grand Rapids. Over seven hundred attendees
      were on hand for the four hundred papers that were presented in
      23 organized symposia.  Additionally, a number of workshops,
      great social activities, and a wonderful panel on climate change
      were offered. Six members of the local section were on the
      organizing committee, and the meeting was very well received.

      In October, our 29<sup>th</sup> annual Chemistry Day at the
      Kalamazoo Valley Museum was a great success. Eighty volunteers
      presented over twenty activities and experiments to 1,000
      attendees!  Stay tuned for news about our 30<sup>th</sup> annual
      Chemistry Day in October 2016.
    </p>
<p>
  We ended the year at Bell's in November for our Recycle-A-Poster
  event. It was great to see the breadth of science occurring in
  the local community, and Karson Putt's presentation on
  inhibiting the progression of malaria was very well received.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to these events, our section also sponsored two
  Project SEED students this year, we completed our third Climate
  Science Event for local teachers, we had events at two venues
  for Chemists Celebrate Earth Day, we co-sponsored Dr. Daniel
  Rabinovich's Chemistry on Stamps talk a WMU, and we supported
  both the WMU CGSA Spring Picnic and the Kalamazoo College DowBQ.
</p>

<p>
  Stay tuned, as the first announcements from our 2016 event
  schedule should be coming your way after the holidays.

<h1 id="haverhill">Halloween at Haverhill</h1>
<p class="author">By Angela Willson</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      Haverhill Elementary School in Portage celebrated their second
      annual Halloween Science Day on October 30<sup>th</sup>. They
      invited Angela Willson to return to kick off the day with a full
      school assembly. The 450 elementary students experienced
      <em>spooky</em> science firsthand with many <em>spooky</em>
      science demonstrations. The focus of our discussion this year
      was on physical and chemical changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students saw physical changes like dry ice bubbles and pop
      rocks in soda to see how this is only a physical change as no
      new carbon dioxide is produced. Doing this demonstration allowed
      us to break the myth that eating pop rocks and drinking soda
      will make your stomach explode! The students also got to see
      chemical reactions like baking soda and vinegar to see how
      carbon dioxide can be produced through a chemical reaction. The
      crowd favorite was the <em>Oozing Pumpkin</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haverhill Elementary School was excited to invite Angela back
      for another Halloween Science demonstration for next year.

<p class="author">By Sarut Jianrattanasawat</p>

<p>
  On November 18, 2015 the Chemistry Graduate Student Association
  (CGSA) hosted a Thanksgiving Potluck for the Chemistry undergraduate
  and graduate students, faculty, and staff of the Dept of Chemistry
  at Western Michigan University. The event was an opportunity for
  international students and their families to celebrate the American
  Thanksgiving tradition.
</p>
<p>
  The event was successful and well attended. Thank you to KACS for
  financial support and helping us make this a great event.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you to Kelly Current and Don Kidd for making the turkey for
  the Thanksgiving potluck.

<h1 id="ice-cream">Welcome Ice-Cream Social Report</h1>
<p class="author">By Sarut Jianrattanasawat</p>
<p>
  On September 25, 2015 the Chemistry Graduate Student Association
  (CGSA) hosted an ice cream social for the undergraduate and graduate
  students, faculty, and staff of the Department of Chemistry. The aim
  of this event was to introduce the new students to the existing
  student body.  With more than 60 people attending, students were
  able to make new connections, get to know the student organizations
  as well as catch up with old friends. Thank you KACS for helping us
  make this a successful event.

<h1 id="communications-chair">New Communications Chair</h1>
<h2>Introducing Chris Pruis, KACS's New Communications Chair</h2>
<p>
  Hello, Kalamazoo-area chemists! I am excited to be the next local
  section Communications Chair.  While I know it will be nearly
  impossible to fill David Bolliet's empty seat, I will do my best to
  keep you informed about community events and news.  However, before
  I get to work, I thought you might like to know a little about
  me. While I was born and raised right here in Kalamazoo, it was only
  recently that I was again able to call this place home after nearly
  twenty years away. So, here is my story&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  I attended Valparaiso University where I graduated in 1999 with
  honors in Chemistry. During two of my undergrad summer vacations I
  completed internships right here in Kalamazoo at Pharmacia &amp;
  Upjohn (1998) and Pharmacia (1999) before heading off to graduate
  school. I completed my doctoral work in Richard Silverman's lab at
  Northwestern University were I studied MOA-B inactivators (2004). At
  this point I left the shores of Lake Michigan to live in the desert
  of Arizona. For ten years I was a full-time teaching faculty at
  Arizona State University where I oversaw the undergraduate organic
  chemistry teaching labs (~1200 students) and taught ground and
  online organic chemistry lectures (~400 students). While at ASU my
  scholarly interests focused on the use of media in chemical
  education and on improving ways to mentor developing chemistry
  educators. In the spring of 2011 I was awarded the College of
  Liberal Arts and Science's Outstanding Lecturer Award. My
  involvement with ACS local sections began in Arizona, and for two
  years (2006 &amp; 2007) I was the Central Arizona local section
  chair.
</p>
<p>
  Despite my positive experiences in Arizona, in the spring of 2014 I
  left my Senior Lecturer position at ASU to pursue a new challenge as
  the Chemistry Subject Matter Expert at W. W. Norton and Co, an
  employee-owned publishing company based out of Manhattan. I work out
  of my home assisting our online homework faculty users with their
  courses and developing new chemistry multi-media learning tools with
  the Norton product team and editorial staff. This new position gave
  our family the freedom to move back to this much colder climate. (I
  personally did not like the 120 degree summers!) When not working, I
  enjoy spending time with my husband Tim, my two children (8 and 6
  years old), and my two dogs. Some of my hobbies include reading, rug
  weaving, home re-modeling (Tim and I flipped three homes in AZ),
  hiking, bargain-shopping, and meeting new people!
</p>
<p>
  That being said&hellip;I look forward to meeting you at an upcoming
  local section event!
</p>
