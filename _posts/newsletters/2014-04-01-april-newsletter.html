      Spring is almost here. Plants will soon turn green due to
      chlorophyll.  Chlorophyll has a highly conjugated cyclic
      structure with heterocyclic nitrogen- containing rings. Two of
      the nitrogen atoms are negative, and magnesium is the
      counterion.  Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, and
      reflects green light and accordingly makes plants appear green.

      St. Patrick's Day has just passed and of course the Chicago
      river was once again dyed green to mark the day. Since green is
      such a common color, artists have looked for green pigments
      suitable for painting. One of the earliest green pigments is
      malachite, which was used by the Egyptians in their
      artwork. Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral,
      having the formula
      Cu<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. In the first
      century the Romans used malachite as a green pigment. Another
      copper- containing pigment is verdigris. Verdigris is the green
      patina which forms on copper as it weathers. It may be formed by
      exposing copper to acetic acid and scraping the powder off the
      copper. This would form copper(II) acetate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, copper may simply be allowed to weather in which
      case the verdigris formed is copper carbonate. Verdigris is
      lightfast and stable in oil paint although it is not stable in
      other media. It was widely used because of its desirable
      blue-green color. Another green pigment used since Roman times
      is Verona green. It is a clay colored by a mixture of iron oxide
      and silicates of magnesium, aluminum and potassium such as
      potassium aluminum silicate.  Cobalt green is another green
      pigment which does not contain copper. It is made by heating a
      mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide. Sven Rinman, a
      Swedish chemist, discovered this compound in 1780. Chrome green
      was patented in 1859. The pigment contains chromium oxide
      dihydrate. It is stable and not toxic. Copper phthalocyanine is
      a more modern green pigment. By adding substituents the color
      may be varied from green to blue.
