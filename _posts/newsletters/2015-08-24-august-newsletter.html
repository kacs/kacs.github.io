      The spring was very busy for our section. Our annual awards
      gathering was held May 11 at Western (full report next
      month). The third climate change workshop was held on May 16 at
      KRESA, completing the grant we received from National ACS. As
      our grand finale, we co-hosted
      the <a href="http://jglcrm2015.com" title="Meeting website">
	Joint Meeting</a> in Grand Rapids at the end of May,
      where over 700 attendees were able to choose from 398 papers
      across 23 symposia and two large poster sessions. It was
      rewarding to see the meeting take off with a life of its own
      after so much planning! A special thank you to those of you who
      attended the Industrial Member Focus Session with the national
      leadership. It was great to see so many members of the local
      section participating in what turned out to be a fruitful
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are already looking forward to the fall. Planning is already
      underway for what I expect to be a very
      enjoyable <a href="/event/2015/10/17/chemistry-day-at-the-museum.html"
      title="Event page">Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley
      Museum</a> in October. We are working on planning a fall Science
      Cafe, and let’s not forget our annual November gathering. As
      always, don’t hesitate to let us know if you have anything else
      you’d like to see us do.

  Chemistry Day at the Museum
</h1>
<p class="author">By John Miller</p>
<p>Dear friends, colleagues and fellow-members of the ACS:</p>
<p>National Chemistry Week (NCW) is coming up soon! <b>Please join the fun!</b></p>
<p>
  NCW will be celebrated this year during the week of October 18-24,
  and its theme this year is "Chemistry Colors Our World!" exploring
  the chemistry of dyes, pigments, and light. The Kalamazoo Section's
  largest and most extensive annual outreach to the community is our
  <strong>Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum</strong> (KVM) on <strong>October 17,
  from 12 to 4 pm</strong>. During the Chemistry Day event, our members
  and friends spend 4 hours on a Saturday afternoon presenting
  chemistry-related hands-on activities to many young people and their
  families who come to visit the museum and to learn about the joys
  and impacts of chemistry and its usefulness.  Many visitors will
  receive materials to take home and read, do and share with their
  parents, teachers and friends. Annette Hoppenworth and her staff at
  the KVM work hard to assure the success of this outreach event, and
  their commitment is critical to the event's success.
</p>

<p>
  Dr. Lydia M. Hines has stepped down, after 27(!) years of tireless
  service, as our local coordinator for NCW. Dr. John B. Miller will
  be taking over the reins. Please contact him to let him know what
  activity you would like to present at <strong>269-387-2871</strong>
  or <a href="mailto:john.b.miller@wmich.edu" title="E-mail John Miller">
    john.b.miller@wmich.edu</a>. There is a modest budget for
  the event, so if you will need assistance with purchase of materials
  inform John of the need and the approximate expense when you contact
  him.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for helping youth get excited about Chemistry!
</p>

<h1 id="jglcrm">The Joint Great Lakes/Central Regional Meeting 2015</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines, General Co-Chair</p>

<p>
  Wednesday to Saturday, May 27-30, were days filled with exercise as
  700+ registrants traveled between and within the Amway Grand Hotel
  and DeVos Halls in downtown Grand Rapids to take in all that was
  offered at this Regional Meeting.
</p>
<img src="http://jglcrm2015.com/images/marquee.jpg" alt="JGLCRM marquee" />
<p>
  Thanks are due to many of our local section members &ndash; seasoned
  chemists and students &ndash; who contributed to the success of this
  meeting through sponsorship of technical/social/networking events,
  exhibiting in our extensive exposition, organizing symposia (there
  were 24 unique symposia), giving technical presentations either
  orally or in our 2 large and highly popular poster sessions, all
  organized to accommodate the 397 abstracts submitted from the US and
  abroad. In addition to the symposia there were a plenary speaker and
  two keynote speakers.
</p>
<p>
  Six ACS Governance representatives were in attendance the whole
  time, interacting with attendees, participating in technical
  sessions and social events (one took in the Fun Run as well);
  present and busily contributing to the smooth execution of the event
  were staff from the Washington office (often unsung heroes at ACS
  meetings of any size). AND, the newly-appointed ACS Executive
  Director, for whom this was the FIRST Regional Meeting of his
  tenure, was enthused by what he saw and heard at the JGLCRM2015.
</p>
<p>
  A KACS area teacher received special recognition at the Awards
  Banquet: Mr. Brad Portis, chemistry teacher at Gull Lake High
  School, received the ACS's Division of Chemical Education Great
  Lakes Region Award for Excellence in High School Chemistry Teaching
  and as such is eligible to be considered for the national James
  Bryant Conant Award!
</p>
<p>
  Informal conversations with samples of individuals in attendance
  &ndash; from students to experienced professional chemists &ndash;
  netted comments that the meeting was a very profitable experience
  professionally and interpersonally.
</p>
<p>
  Special thanks are due to those of our Section who worked tirelessly
  on the planning and execution of this professionally-enriching
  meeting: <b>James J. Kiddle</b> (WMU) and <b>Brian M.  Eklov</b>
  (Kalexsyn), Program co-chairs; <b>Elke Schoffers</b> (WMU),
  Publicity chair and Exposition chair; <b>Sherine Obare</b> (WMU),
  Awards co-chair; and <b>Mark Wolf</b> (Kalsec and now U of I &ndash;
  Chicago), the webmaster.

<h1>Outreach Events</h1>
<h2>Chemists Celebrate Earth Day</h2>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>

<p>
  Maren Zanotti again spearheaded the Section's participation at the
  Kalamazoo Nature Center, which coincided with the Center’s Earth Day
  celebration on Saturday, April 18. From 8:30am to 4pm Students from
  WMU and Kalamazoo College chemistry clubs worked in tandem to
  distribute copies of an activity-packed theme-related publication,
  <i>Celebrating Chemistry</i>, titled &ldquo;Climate Science: More than just a
  Weather Report&rdquo; and developed by the American Chemical Society, and
  to help youngsters make chromatography butterflies. As always,
  families were most appreciative of the science-related information
  and hands-on project.
</p>
<p>
  The following Saturday, April 25, was a cold, overcast day, so the
  &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; program planned by the Oshtemo Branch of the
  Kalamazoo Public Library was moved indoors. The library staff
  arranged for us to have a table in the entrance hallway, and as in
  previous years it gave us a great opportunity to interact with the
  families that were there for the planned Music event. Brian Eklov
  and Lydia Hines were able to draw in about 50 children with demos of
  &ldquo;Magic Sand"rdquo:, color-changing beads, and
  &ldquo;indicator&rdquo; demonstrations. Parents happily followed
  their children to our table and copies of <i>Celebrating
  Chemistry</i> were gratefully received; the first patron at our
  table was a 4 th grade science teacher and she was so excited to
  hear about our KACS offerings through the year!
</p>

<h2>
  Report on the 3<sup>rd</sup> (and Last) Climate Science Toolkit
  Event
</h2>
<p>By Steve Bertman</p>
<p>
  This last event, in the series of three we arranged to hold based on
  the Climate Science grant received from National ACS under Bassam
  Shakhashiri's leadership, went extremely well. We had our largest
  class and we were better at managing our time/technology so that
  there was less rushing and more time for questions. We had 14
  participants. The workshop consisted of 4 sections
  <ol>
    <li>the scientific basis of climate change</li>
    <li>the ecological consequences of climate change</li>
    <li>the economic consequences of climate change</li>
    <li>the potential technological, social, and personal actions</li>
  </ol>
  Each section had a content portion and a classroom-ready activity
  using online resources including the ACS Climate Toolkit. We
  distributed to each participant a flash drive with copies of
  resources and an editable version of the activities to make adoption
  of the activities in their own classrooms easier. Many of the
  participants also took copies of the ACS Earth Day activity booklets
  for their classrooms. The day appeared to be very well received. One
  veteran teacher said that it was the best professional development
  event she has been to!

<h2><i>Chemistry on Stamps</i>, a Lecture by Dr. Daniel Rebinovich</h2>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>
<p>
  Dr. Rabinovich was in Kalamazoo on 17 April 2015 to visit the WMU
  Chemistry Department as a repeat of a weather-aborted visit planned
  for 2011; that also happened to be the day that the Chemistry
  Department had a presentation of research posters showing work being
  accomplished by students in the department and also made its
  end-of-year awards to outstanding students. At the completion of the
  awards ceremony there was a very appreciative audience to hear
  Dr. Rabinovich's presentation on a portion of his extensive
  collection of stamps from around the world, stamps which commemorate
  a variety of events, elements, inventors, concepts, and some
  mis-concepts, connected with our profession. He described how he
  uses these stamps to engage his beginning chemistry students in the
  understanding the evolution of the practice of chemistry over the
  years - starting with alchemy, showing the importance of safety, and
  bringing to life the idea that chemistry is universal and is
  appreciated worldwide.

<h2>A "Pat on our Backs" for our Competitive Exam Awards</h2>
<p class="author">By Lydia Hines</p>
<p>
  Once in a while, several years after her child has received an award
  from the KACS, I hear from a parent that she joyfully remembers the
  ceremony at which we have awarded that child, and she goes on to
  give me a story about the recipient's educational achievements since
  that time.
</p>

<p>
  On 21 May of this year, 2015, I heard a great interview on WMUK,
  which again gives us reason to be pleased that as a section we
  continue to make a small difference by rewarding our local High
  School students: the first-place winner of our 2012 Competitive
  Exam, Stephen John (Portage Central &amp; KAMSC), matriculated at
  WMU in the Lee Honors College and this year is graduating with a
  Bachelors degree in Biomedical Sciences and Mechanical Engineering;
  he is on his way to the University of Michigan Medical School and
  recently was named a co-recipient (with fellow WMU student Joseph
  Barnett) of the MIT-Lemelson Collegiate Student Prize for the
  development of a respiratory device for use in premature infants in
  underdeveloped countries (read the article which describes these
  young men’s story in the Spring 2015 issue
  of <i><a href="http://issuu.com/wmich/docs/wmu-magazine-summer-2015/1"
  title="Link to WMU Magazine">The Western Michigan University
  Magazine</a></i> and/or listen

<h2>Kalamazoo College DowBQ</h2>
<p class="author">By Mara Birndorff</p>
<p>
  In order to foster community and networking among and between the
  biology and chemistry students and faculty at Kalamazoo College, the
  ACS student chapter held the yearly DOWBQ (DOW barbecue) event on 21
  May 2015. Members of the Kalamazoo College ACS student group, and
  other students and faculty in the Dow Science Center made the event
  possible. Professors and other staff brought chips and dessert, and
  students helped set up, grill and run the event. Throughout the
  event, the biology and chemistry students were able to talk about
  their Senior Individualized Projects (SIPs), classes, and other
  summer plans. This event fostered conversation between students of
  different years and majors, as well as with their professors, in a
  more casual, personal environment. This event, always a major
  highlight of the year, was made possible by the financial support
  from KACS. Attendance of 180 surpassed expectations by 80!
