<h1 id="volunteer-policy">ACS Volunteer Local Meeting / Event Attendee Conduct Policy</h1>

<p>
  One of the key strengths of the ACS has been the enduring and varied contributions made by its thousands of dedicated volunteers.
</p>
<p>
  Another unassailable strength of the ACS is its local meetings and events program. ACS local meetings/events offer scientific professionals a legitimate platform to present, publish, discuss, and exhibit research discoveries and technologies in chemistry and its related disciplines in a local setting. Furthermore, ACS local meetings/events facilitate networking opportunities, career development and placement, and provide organizations with opportunities to exhibit products and services to targeted audiences.
</p>
<p>
  The Society's Congressional Charter explicitly lists among its
  objectives "the improvement of the qualifications and usefulness of
  chemists through high standards of professional ethics, education
  and attainments&hellip;". The ACS expects its volunteers and local
  meeting/event attendees to display the highest qualities of personal
  and professional integrity in all aspects of their ACS-related
  activities. Indeed, every chemical professional has obligations to
  the public, to volunteer and staff colleagues, and to science.
</p>
<p>
  Accordingly, and to foster a positive environment built upon a foundation of trust, respect, open communications, and ethical behavior, the Committee on Local Section Activities (LSAC) recommends this Conduct Policy. It applies to ACS Volunteers, i.e., it applies to individuals conducting the business and affairs of the ACS without compensation for that conduct. It also applies to attendees at ACS local meetings/events and is consistent with the policy issued by the ACS Board of Directors for volunteers at ACS National Meetings. Volunteers and meeting/event attendees should at all times abide by this Conduct Policy. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    
  <li>
    Volunteers should understand and support ACS's vision and mission.</li>
  <li>
    Volunteers and local meeting/event attendees should contribute to
    a collegial, inclusive, positive, and respectful environment for
    their fellow volunteers and attendees, as well as for other
    stakeholders, including meeting vendors and ACS staff, when
    present.</li>
  <li>
    Volunteers and local meeting/event attendees must avoid taking any
    inappropriate actions based on race, gender, age, religion,
    ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender expression,
    gender identity, marital status, political affiliation, presence
    of disabilities, or educational background. They should show
    consistent respect to colleagues, regardless of the level of their
    formal education and whether they are from industry, government or
    academia, or other scientific and engineering disciplines.</li>
  <li>
    Volunteers and local meeting/event attendees should interact with
    others in a cooperative and respectful manner. Volunteers and
    local meeting/event attendees should refrain from using insulting,
    harassing, or otherwise offensive language in their ACS
    interactions. Disruptive, harassing, or inappropriate behavior
    toward other volunteers, stakeholders, or staff is
    unacceptable. Personal boundaries set by others must be
    observed. Harassment of any kind, including but not limited to
    unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
    verbal or physical harassment will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li>
    Volunteers must obey all applicable laws and regulations of the
    relevant government authorities while acting on behalf of the
    ACS. Likewise, local meeting/event attendees must obey all
    applicable laws and regulations of the relevant government
    authorities while attending ACS meetings or events. Volunteers and
    local meeting/event attendees alike should also ensure that they
    comply with all applicable safety guidelines relating to public
    chemistry demonstrations.</li>
  <li>
    Volunteers and local meeting/event attendees should only use ACS's
    trademarks, insignia, name, logos, and other intellectual property
    in compliance with ACS regulations and directives as may be issued
    from time to time.</li>
  <li>
    Attendees who participate electronically, either fully or in part,
    in local meetings and events are expected to comply with this
    Conduct Policy.</li>
  <li>
    Violations of this Conduct Policy should be reported promptly to
    the local section officials, who may in turn report violations to
    the ACS Secretary and General Counsel or to the Chair of the ACS
    Board of Directors. In cases of alleged persistent and/or serious
    violations of this Conduct Policy, the Board shall review the
    evidence and shall take such actions as may be appropriate,
    including but not limited to requiring volunteers to leave their
    volunteer position(s); precluding volunteers from serving in
    Society volunteer roles in the future; requiring local meeting
    attendees to leave the meeting; and, precluding meeting attendees
    from attending future ACS meetings. ACS, through its Board of
    Directors, reserves the right to pursue additional measures as it
    may determine are appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Adopted by the Board of Directors 2015-03-22</p>

      In 2018, ACS celebrated the 50th anniversary of Project SEED,
      which provides summer research experiences in chemistry for high
      school students from low income households. This has been a
      powerful program.  Over 11,000 students have participated and
      <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i11/Celebrating-Project-SEEDs-impact.html"
	 title="ACS assessments">ACS assessments</a> show that it has
	 been very influential in shaping the academic and career
	 pathways of those students.  The Kalamazoo local section has
	 sponsored 75 student projects in the last 25 years. Three of
	 these participants were highlighted in a three part
	 mini-series, culminating in the next article. We especially
	 encourage you to check
	 the <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/donate/project-seed-inspiration-lab/who-seed-inspires.html">ACS
	 Project SEED website</a> for some short, inspiring videos
	 that explain how the program has changed student lives.</p>
    <p>
      Under typical funding arrangements, each Project SEED fellowship
      costs our local section about $1750-$2000 per year to ensure
      that students receive compensation equal to State of Michigan
      minimum wage.  ACS provides $1250 or $1500 per year to match our
      local contributions for year one and year two fellows,
      respectively.  We are presently budgeted to sponsor two students
      for Project SEED in Summer 2019.  Any additional projects will
      require additional funds from sponsoring institutions or local
      section funds.</p>
  </div>

<p>
  ACS is gratefully receiving donations to the national program on
  their website but <strong>we are asking all members to consider
    a direct donation to our local program</strong>, which will
  ensure that funds have maximum value to students in our section.
  Any donation of any amount will be appreciated and 100% of
  donated funds will go directly toward student compensation.
  Project mentors and their institutions receive no payment for
  their participation in Project SEED.</p>

<h2>Meet DeShawna (Stevenson) Ladd</h2>

<p>
  Article Three of a Three-Article Mini Series "The Faces of Project
  Seed"
</p>
<p>
  This article is the third in a series celebrating the 50th
  anniversary of the ACS program Project SEED. Project SEED was
  established in 1968 to provide lab experience opportunities for high
  school students who historically lack exposure to scientific
  careers. More information on Project SEED is available on the
  <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/seed/about.html">ACS
    website.</a>
</p>
<p>
  To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the program, KACS is catching
  up with Kalamazoo Project SEED alumni, who are sharing with us
  memories of their experiences with the program and its effect on
  their careers.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      Here we caught up with Kalamazoo Project SEED alumnus,
      Mrs. DeShawna (Stevenson) Ladd, whose career shines as an
      outstanding example of putting to work the Project SEED
      experience in an approach that goes beyond that of traditional
      chemistry applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating from Kalamazoo Central High School, Mrs. Ladd
      (Ms. Stevenson at that time) earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in
      Psychology from Michigan State University.</p>
    <p>
      After MSU, she has applied her psychology degree in a truly
      impressive fashion, working at various times as an Environmental
      Services Associate at Bronson Methodist Hospital, a Community
      Support Specialist at Summit Pointe, a Student Services
      Coordinator at Office Team, a Correspondence Research Specialist
      at Spherion, a Behavior Technician at Centria Healthcare, a
      Resident Coordinator at KPEP, a Substitute Teacher at EDUStaff,
      LLC, and a Behavioral Health PCA at Borgess Health.</p>

<p>
  In addition, in 2017, Mrs. Ladd started her own jewelry company,
  Celestial Intentions, of which she is owner and designer. Here are
  some of the questions and responses from our catch-up time with
  Mrs. Ladd.

      </p>
      <p>
	<i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: I learned about Project SEED in my 11th Grade
	Chemistry class.
      </p>
      <p>
	Our teacher presented it to us towards the end of the year as
	an opportunity to gain more experience in the sciences.

  <p>
    <i>KACS</i>: What would you say was the best part of your Project
    SEED experience?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: The best part of my Project SEED experience was
    experiencing college, before college! I learned so much about
    BioChemistry, Chemistry, and life while I participated in this
    program. It matured me for the better before I went off to
    college.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>KACS</i>: And the worst part?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: After the first week or two of the program in
    2003, Dr. Reinhold was out of town. While he was gone I continued
    my research according to the instructions left for me. (Well at
    least I thought.) Upon his return, he asked to see the cell
    cultures I had been working on. As he looked at the petri dishes
    under the microscope, he noticed none of them had cells! I had
    wasted at least a gallon of media thinking they had cells in them!
    It was an embarrassing learning experience!
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>
    <i>KACS</i>: Would you say that participation in Project SEED
    influenced your decision to attend MSU after high school? And at
    MSU you majored in psychology, not a traditional chemistry
    program. Even so, would you say that participation in Project SEED
    helped you in any way with successfully obtaining your MSU degree?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: Project SEED did not exactly influence my choice
    to attend Michigan State University. My original major was
    Engineering, however I wasn't the best with math, and realized
    that wasn't the studies for me! I switched to Psychology because I
    was always intrigued by how the mind works. Participating in
    Project SEED also got me get my first work-study job on campus. I
    was a Lab Aide in the Biological Sciences Department.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having the work-study opportunity helped out a lot in paying to
    get my degree! Participating in Project SEED helped a lot with
    things I encountered while at MSU. I learned how to better conduct
    myself in the classroom and on campus from Project SEED. My time
    in Project SEED showed me how to push myself academically.

      <p>
	<i>KACS</i>: After MSU, your career involved working in the

	necessarily chemistry-involving areas, did your experience
	with Project SEED help you in anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
	<i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: Yes. I "learned" people better during my
	time in Project SEED. I was a very shy teenager, in High
	School, on a college campus doing research with college
	students and professors. I was forced out of this shell I was
	in at the time. Project SEED gave me more confidence in
	engaging, and working with all kinds of people.

      <p>
	<i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: Absolutely! I make jewelry using copper, and
	healing stones. Copper is a conductor of energy. It is said to
	help the body repair tissues, oxygenate the blood, increase
	vitality, ease pain, and stimulate the brain, among many
	others. When the copper is wrapped around the healing stones,
	it amplifies the energy of the stone. Increasing the healing

    today's high school chemistry students?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: I would definitely recommend participation in
    Project SEED to today's students!!! It is a wonderful, once in a
    lifetime opportunity that very few students get! It is an awesome
    learning experience. One preparing you not only for college, but
    the future!

  <p>
    <i>Mrs. Ladd</i>: Don't be afraid to ask questions! The more you
    ask, the more you will benefit. Get to know your professors, and
    students you're in the lab with. You can make some lifelong
    connections. Take it seriously! It's an honor to be selected to
    participate in this program. Please don't take the experience for
    granted!

<p>
  Our brief discussion with Mrs. Ladd provided yet another excellent
  validation of the value of KACS' and area high school students'
  participation in Project SEED.
