      KACS has been named a <strong>ChemLuminary Award
      finalist</strong> by the Local Section Activities Committee
      (LSAC) for <strong><em>Outstanding Performance by a Local
      Section</em> in our local section size category</strong> - which
      currently is Medium Small (we have ~320 members). Our current
      chair of the KACS received this exciting news during the week of
      October 19.  The selection was made after review of our 2019
      Annual Report* which we submitted in February of 2020 –
      congratulations are in order to each member who contributed to
      any of our many successful programs during 2019!
    </p>

<p>
  The ChemLuminary Awards program usually happens at the Fall ACS
  meeting and is filled with much anticipation and excitement as
  awards are announced and presented to groups and individuals
  identified as winners by each of 23 different ACS Committees. Since
  the 2020 Fall meeting was in an all-virtual format this celebratory
  event did not take place in August; an online celebration is
  scheduled for <strong>Wednesday, December 9 at 4 pm Eastern
  time!</strong> That is when winners for each award will be
  announced. We hope that many of our <strong>KACS members</strong>
  will be able to

<h1 id="helen-free-award">Lydia E.M. Hines, Ph.D., Wins ACS' Helen
M. Free Award Local Section celebrates</h1>

<p>
  Helen Free was past President of the ACS in 1993 and participated in
  the establishment of Kids & Chemistry, a program in which scientists
  do hands-on activities with elementary school students. As chair of
  the National Chemistry Week Task Force (1987-1992), she shepherded
  ACS' most successful public outreach program through its formative
  years. She helped originate and led the movement toward a worldwide
  International Chemistry Celebration in 1999, and continued with the
  United Nations' declaration of 2011 as the International Year of
  Chemistry.
</p>
<p>
  The Helen M. Free Award for Public Outreach recognizes outstanding
  achievements in the field of public outreach by a member of the ACS
  who improves public recognition and appreciation for the
  contributions of chemistry. This award was established in 1995 by
  the American Chemical Society Committee on Public Relations and
  Communications (CPRC).
</p>

    <p>
      KACS Councilor and long-time public outreach leader Lydia Hines was
      scheduled to receive the 2020 Helen M. Free Award during the National
      Fall ACS Meeting in San Francisco. Unfortunately, with the Fall Meeting
      being moved to an online meeting, Lydia was unable to receive her award
      in person. With this, the Kalamazoo ACS Section decided to hold a
      recognition event on October 20 for Lydia. Below is the agenda. The
      event was attended on a video meeting by 32 ACS members, including
      friends and family.

</div>

<p>
  Alternate Councilor Doug Williams opened the event with a greeting
  and welcome to Lydia and all in attendance. He then introduced the
  evening's speakers who praised Lydia and outlined her
  accomplishments that made her deserving of this award.
</p>

<blockquote>
  "Lydia motivated me to reach out to children and instill the love of
  chemistry that she demonstrated at chemistry day and at schools she
  visited."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "Lydia's car and house are packed with chemistry experiments that
  are always available for ACS members and teachers to use in their
  demonstrations and classrooms."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "Lydia is so reliable and when she says she will help; she is always
  there."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "Lydia has made us all better."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "She asks, cajoles, and then asks again."
</blockquote>

<p>
  This patience, persistence and dedication has made a difference in
  our local section, our schools, the greater Kalamazoo area and on
  the national ACS stage. Representatives from the National ACS "put
  her in a class by herself." Doug deftly managed the meeting so other
  friends and family could contribute their personal accolades.
</p>
<p>
  Lydia was touched by all these kind words. She then delivered a
  brief overview of her early years and her love of chemistry that
  contributed to this award. Lydia was born in the US and then moved
  to Cyprus with her parents (she is of Greek heritage) to spend her
  early years on that island in the eastern Mediterranean. She
  graduated from Aurora College in Aurora, IL, and then received her
  Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois. After a stint
  with Mead Johnson, in 1975 she joined the Patent Liaison Department
  of the Upjohn Company.

<p>
  In the Spring of 1987, Lydia organized a Chemistry Day at the local
  museum, which was then above the public library. Local chemists
  presented science / chemistry experiments for school children, many
  times wowing their parents as well. This began before the National
  ACS, under Helen Free, initiated National Chemistry Week.  This work
  as well as Lydia's outreach to schools, her local and national ACS
  activities, and her mentoring of other chemists continues
  unabated. Lydia acknowledged her family, friends and the ACS Staff
  and members around the country who have supported her in her love of
  chemistry and her outreach programs for over 40 years. At this
  conclusion the virtual meeting exploded in applause.
</p>
<p>
  Hershel Jude, the Local ACS Chair, thanked Lydia for her wonderful
  words and her patience with everyone who doesn't have as much energy
  as she has. Hershel also put in a plug for obtaining more volunteers
  for education committee activities that Lydia champions.

    <strong>Note from Lydia:</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	I want to extend my sincere appreciation to Hershel, Ed, and
	Doug for their kind effort and successful execution of this
	large ZOOM recognition on October 20. It was delightful, yet
	somewhat embarrassing, to be the focus of so much attention,
	but the choice of speakers was absolutely spot-on, as they
	were representative of the span of years, as well as the
	variety of outreach, with which I have been
	involved. Impromptu comments from other colleagues who joined
	the celebration from different areas of the country were
	heart-warming as they represented ACS' presence and impact on
	the national level.
