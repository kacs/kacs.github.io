# Comments from the Chair

<div class="chair-comments">
  <div class="comments-content col-md-8">
    <P class="author">By Steve Secreast</p>
    <p>
      "The last bastion of inertness has finally fallen." Did you see
      <a href="http://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i7/Helium-forms-stable-molecules-high.html"
	 title="View helium article">this C&amp;EN article</a> in early
      February? A research team from Skolkovo Institute and Nankai
      University got helium to react with sodium under pressure to
      make a stable form of Na<sub>2</sub>He. Turns out that even
      helium is active when it comes to chemistry. We can learn
      something from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fully agree with comments received from a number of local
      section members during and after our recently successful
      75<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration that we would like to
      see more events like this occur. That can happen if we overcome
      inertness and get more involved in the local section. Okay, it's
      not really fair to say that we tend to be inert, but that was a
      good link to the helium article.
    </p> 
    <p>
      We are all very busy with families, work, school and life, and
      finding time to volunteer with local section activities is not
      easy or our highest priority. With even a little more member
      involvement though, we could do more fun and educational
      chemistry-related events here in our local area.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some of us were talking recently about our favorite chemistry
      demonstrations that we've done at various local schools. This
      got me thinking; it could be cool to form a team of us to go to
      local schools with a <strong>chem demonstration
      program</strong>. Having a team do this means that we would each
      only have to do one demonstration (our favorite), but we'd have
      a multi-demonstration program. Could call this group <em>The
      Traveling Kalchemists</em>, or something like that. Let me know
      please, if this sounds like something of interest, and let's
      discuss it some more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If that sounds like too much, how about <strong>volunteering for
	our upcoming <em>Chemists Celebrate Earth Day</em></strong>?
	This is a one-day deal (22 April) and we need volunteers to
	work exhibit tables, with materials and information
	provided. Working with the kids that come to this event leaves
	one with a feeling of satisfaction that is rare.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss having recurring full-membership <strong>meetings with
      speakers</strong>? I do, and I think that if a few people are
      willing to step up and help me with that, we can get them going
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also of great interest to me continues to be finding someone
      willing to step up and take on the <strong>2017 Chair-Elect /
      2018 Chair position</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have with the outstanding group of chemists in our area, the
      potential for making KACS an even more vibrant and active
      organization heading into our next 75 years. We as members just
      need to donate some of our time and talent to make that reaction
      go. Please let me or any Executive Committee member know if you
      can help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks,<br />
      Steve

The theme for Chemists Celebrate Earth Day (CCED) this year is
*Chemistry Helps Feed the World*. We have scheduled 2
outreach events in April: The first one will be at the Celery Flats
in Portage on Saturday, April 15, from 11 am to 3 pm during their
Earth Day activities, and the second will be at the Kalamazoo Nature
Center on Saturday, April 22 (9 am &ndash; 4 pm) during their Earth
Day celebration (with free admission to the Nature Center grounds);
at both venues there will be age-appropriate information and
hands-on activities for the patrons.

Though the WMU Chem Club members have agreed to present at these two
outreach opportunities, that should not preclude KACS member
participation on one or both of these days and venues. Patrons are
always eager to learn new things about chemistry and to receive
materials which they can take home for their further exploration with
family, scout leaders and teachers &ndash; ACS is very generous in its
provision of materials.

Lydia Hines is the Section's CCED coordinator again this year and you
may [**contact her**](/people/hines.html 'Info page for Lydia') if you
would like to join the fun.

<h1 id="anniversary">Report KACS' 75th Anniversary Celebration</h1>


Our Michigan winter held off for several days in the last week of February so our
celebration on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of that month was a less harrowing experience than it
could have been; it was a fantastic one!

![75th Anniversary Dinner](/images/events/air-zoo-2017/dinner.jpg)

<p class="caption">The group enjoying the meal at the Air Zoo</p>

The venue was the Kalamazoo Air Zoo where we had a delightful dinner
catered by AV Catering, complete with the chef wearing an apron we
gave him that said “Get Cooking with Chemistry”; we sat at tables in
the shadow of the Zoo’s SR71B; we had four of the Air Zoo “rides”
available to attendees of all ages (there were about 100 adult members
and friends, and 39 children who attended); there was a buzz of
conversation and great camaraderie. The program was streamlined so as
not to be excessively long: cutting of the celebratory cake from Amy’s
Cakes was followed by a lecture on the SR71B, the fastest airplane
ever built, by Mr, John Boase, a docent at the Air Zoo, recognition of
the 10 past chairs of the section who were present, recognition of
members with 50- 60- and 70- years of membership in the ACS, ending
with a very informative presentation on the ACS and its current
emphases by its Executive Director and CEO, Dr. Thomas
Connelly. Though none of the three members of our Section with 70+
continuous years of ACS membership (Dr. Fred Kagan, 71 years,
Dr. Harold Hart, 75 years, and Dr. Donald Iffland, 75 years) was able
to attend, Dr. Connelly personally visited Dr. Iffland before arriving
at our celebration to help with the set-up! The one 61-year member
present, along with his wife, was Dr. Howard Whaley.

A celebration such as this does not just “happen” - many of our current section
members participated in its successful execution; special thanks go to James
Kiddle and Sarut Jianrattanasawatt for arranging for the meal and the cakes; to
Steve Secreast for supplying the continuously-running background power-point
chemistry- and Section trivia-quiz and historical photos, the 7-foot banner with
our logo and the pint glasses engraved with our logo, available to the first 100
registrants; to Andre Venter for keeping track of the reservations; to Mark Wolf
for helping to set up the PayPal account for the event; to Christine Pruis for
sending out our newsletters and other timely information; to Elke Schoffers for
soliciting funds for the event and being the photographer; and to Brian Eklov and
Lydia Hines for gathering archival information.


We look forward to our 100th anniversary and the years leading up to that!

# March for Science in Kalamazoo

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p><strong>Saturday 22 April 2017</strong></p>
    <p>Location and time still to be determined</p>
    <p>
      It's looking that Kalamazoo will have a local satellite version
      of the March For Science, being planned for 22 April. ACS has
      issued statements in support of the March (see the blue box link
      on the ACS website or follow the link below).  KACS is looking
      into options for local section participation in the Kalamazoo
      March. Additional information will be relayed as planning
      progresses and more details become available.

# Being Ambassadors for Chemistry Makes a Difference!

<p class="author">by Lydia Hines</p>

As was shared in the February newsletter, our participation at Lake Center
Elementary School's first-ever science night (STEM night) was greatly
appreciated. In a more recent communication from the school, the principal
expressed vividly that the interest generated that evening has grown, so she
extended an invitation to all members of our section to a March 23 (6:30 - 8:00
pm) celebration of the children's continued enthusiasm for science; there they will
be showcasing their science-related achievements - some completed and others
still in progress - since that well-attended event on October 20, 2016. Our
Section "ambassadors" to that event were the WMU Chem Club & Lydia Hines.
