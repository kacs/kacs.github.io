<h1 id="chemistry-day">Chemistry Day at the Museum</h1>

<p>
  <strong>
    Chemistry Day @ the Museum<br />
    Saturday October 13, 2018<br />
    12 noon – 4 pm<br />
    Kalamazoo Valley Museum<br />
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum is right around the
  corner! As in the past this well attended annual event (~ 1000
  children and adults) is held in conjunction
  with <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/ncw.html"
  alt="National chemistry week website">National Chemistry Week</a>
  (NCW). The 2018 theme is <em>Chemistry is out of this
  world</em>. The Fall 2018 Kalamazoo Valley Museum
  publication, <em>museON</em>, page 14, had
  an <a href="https://www.kalamazoomuseum.org/info/museON/museographies/MuseON_Fall%202018_.pdf"
  title="MuseON article">enthusiastic article</a> about the impact
  which KACS members have had on our community over many years, with
  positive mention of this outreach event which has continued for the
  past 31 years.

    <strong>We still need a lot of helping hands from our members for
      this much anticipated event!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We would love to hear that you are interested in volunteering; if
    you are not sure what you might want to present we have a list of
    activity suggestions from prior years, or you may want to work
    alongside someone else as a "helper" at a table. Please join the
    few who have responded to date and contact our NCW
    coordinator <a href="/people/hines.html">Lydia Hines</a> -
    advanced planning makes the event more pleasurable.

<h1 id="voyage-to-mars">National Chemistry Week Event</h1>

<h2>Voyage to Mars: Red Planet Chemistry</h2>

<p>
  <strong>
    Tuesday, Oct 23, 6:45 – 8:00 pm (Mole Day)
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    The Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical Society is hosting
    this free public event at two locations (see registration info
    below).
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  Help us celebrate National Chemistry Week by gathering for a group
  mission to explore the chemistry of Mars! A panel of experts from
  NASA, Rice, Clemson, Emory and the National Radio Astronomy
  Observatory will join us in a live webinar and social media event to
  explain what we know about the Red Planet and the steps necessary to
  safely send men and women to walk on its surface. Discover the
  challenges of long-term space travel and the materials,
  biochemistry, and astrochemistry that will help make this mission
  possible.
</p>

<p>
  We have come a long way since early astronomers gazed through simple
  telescopes and theorized about massive canals on the Red
  Planet. Orbital satellites have begun to map its surface in detail
  and robotic rovers are working to unlock the chemical and geologic
  secrets.
</p>

<p>
  Come and learn:
  <ul>
    <li>How the Curiosity Rover has revealed the geologic history of Mars.</li>
    <li>About the environments that existed on the surface of Earth
      and Mars during the time when life evolved.</li>
    <li>
      The unique challenges of long term space travel and an update on
      current efforts to ensure that humans can survive the
      voyage.</li>
    <li>How biopharmaceutical production can recycle waste into
      valuable materials.</li>
  </ul>

<h1 id="project-seed">Project SEED: Meet Daniel Calco</h1>

<h2>
  Article One of a Three-Article Mini Series <em>The Faces of Project
    Seed</em>
</h2>

<p>
  As you have heard here, ACS is celebrating the 50<sup>th</sup>
  anniversary of Project SEED, which was established to provide lab
  experience opportunities for high school students who historically
  lack exposure to scientific careers. More information
  on Project SEED is available on
  <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/seed/about.html"
     title="Project SEED website">the ACS website</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This summer, we had one Project SEED student, Daniel Calco. Daniel
  is between his sophomore and junior years at Portage Northern High
  School and the Kalamazoo Area Math & Science Center, where he has
  studied chemistry with Ms. Chika Hampton.

</p>
<p>
  Daniel’s Summer 2018 research project was to synthesize and purify
  novel non-nitrogenous serotonin-receptor ligands to combat
  neurodegenerative diseases under the direction of Prof.  Dwight
  Williams in the Chemistry Department at Kalamazoo College. Daniel
  especially appreciated the opportunity to apply his knowledge of
  chemistry in a practical way and to learn to use new tools such as
  NMR spectroscopy. He also has a strong interest in computer science
  and is excited to explore ways to combine this interest with further
  study in chemistry.
</p>
<p>
  Daniel presented his work in departmental symposium at Kalamazoo
  College on August 22 in the Dow Science Center and will be sending a
  summary report to the ACS soon. He expresses special thanks to
  Prof. Williams for the experience.
</p>
<p>
  We would like to grow our program for next year. Please watch our
  upcoming communications for invitations to participate as mentors
  and sponsors for Summer 2019 Project SEED students in our
  section. Members who would like to learn more are welcome to contact
  our local Project SEED coordinator <a href="/people/williams.html"

  The GLRM Programming Committee needs your help! We want to know what
  symposia YOU want to see at the upcoming Great Lakes Regional
  Meeting in Lisle, IL. We have outlined some broadly defined program
  tracks for the meeting, but need to hear your ideas so we can fill
  those tracks with
  symposia. Please <a href="https://www.2019acsglrm.org/callforsymposia"
  title="GLRM submissions">submit</a> your ideas for symposia online.
</p>

<p>
  The GLRM Programming Committee will review all symposia submissions
  ahead of the call for abstracts. If you have any questions please
  contact the Program Chairs Dan Kissel (<a href="kisselda@lewisu.edu"
  title="E-mail Dan">kisselda@lewisu.edu</a>) and/or Josh Kurutz
  (<a href="mailto:jkurutz@alumni.caltech.edu" title="E-mail
  Josh">jkurutz@alumni.caltech.edu</a>). We look forward to hearing
  your ideas!
