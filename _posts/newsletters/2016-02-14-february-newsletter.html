      While I am sure we still have some cold weather ahead of us this
      year, the lengthening daylight is already making me look forward
      to spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The KACS Executive Committee has been hard at work lining up our
      event schedule for the year; I, for one, am looking forward to
      them!  Perennial favorites will return &ndash; Chemists
      Celebrate Earth Day will happen on April 23. <strong>Volunteers
      still needed!</strong> Send me an email if you are interested.
      followed by our Annual Awards gathering which will take place on
      May 9, after we have completed giving the competitive high
      school exam and evaluating this year’s nominees for Outstanding
      High School Teacher. We will be hosting our 30 th Annual
      Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum on October 8, and
      we will be meeting again in November at Bell’s for our annual
      Recycle-A-Poster event. We are also working on a series of new
      events to add to this year’s schedule – see the Alton Brown
      announcement below, and watch future newsletters for
      announcements!

  KACS has reserved a block of tickets for members who are interested in
  attending the Alton Brown Live show on Thursday, May 5th at 7:30 PM. The
  well-known television personality and author has a knack for explaining
  kitchen science in an engaging and entertaining manner. Don’t worry,
  though, our tickets are out of the “splash zone”. The KACS seating will be
  near the back of the orchestra level, and tickets are $35 each (after our KACS
  subsidy).

<h1 id="">Report on ACS Leadership Institute</h1>
<p class="author">By Brian Eklov</p>
<p>
  Each January, ACS hosts the ACS Leadership Institute in Dallas, TX. This
  event provides vital training on how to lead with great success.
  Participants gain an understanding of the essential elements of effective
  leadership and an opportunity to interact with other local section and
  technical division officers and ACS governance. Leadership development
  courses help participants develop core skills important in ACS leadership
  roles as well as in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
  This year was my second opportunity to
  attend the ACS Leadership Institute. As
  always, the weekend was packed to the
  gills with sessions covering a wide array
  of topics related to the ACS’s local
  sections, and I was able to attend
  sessions that complemented my
  previous experience at the conference.
  Due to the networking prompted by this
  event, we are currently working on joint
  events with the St. Joseph Valley and
  Milwaukee Local Sections, so watch our
  newsletter and Facebook page for
  announcements!
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to hear more about the
  ACS Leadership Event and learn how
  you can attend or otherwise participate,

    <h2>Student Competition</h2>
    <p>
      For the thirty-fifth consecutive year, the KACS is sponsoring a
      chemistry examination competition for all high school students
      in Allegan, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren counties.  The competition
      consists of a preliminary and final examination. This year the
      preliminary examination will take place on Tuesday, March 22,
      2016 at all high schools that register. High scorers will be
      invited to the final examination on April 23, 2016 at Western
      Michigan University where they will compete for twenty
      scholarships. If you would like more information, contact a high
      school chemistry teacher or email the KACS test coordinator:

<h2>Wanted: Outstanding High School Chemistry Teachers!</h2>
<p>
  At its annual spring award reception the Kalamazoo Section of the American
  Chemical Society honors an Outstanding High School Chemistry Teacher from
  one of the three counties (Allegan, Kalamazoo, Van Buren) in our Local
  Section. This year we are asking for your cooperation in identifying qualified
  candidates. The applicant for Outstanding High School Chemistry Teacher
  should be able to impart to students a strong understanding of basic chemical
  principles while inspiring students to choose a career in chemistry. The ideal
  applicant would use innovative teaching methods and be active in keeping
  current with the field of chemistry.

      KACS hosted its annual poster session titled
      "Sustainable Science - Recycle a Poster" at Bell's
      Eccentric Café in downtown Kalamazoo on Nov. 10,
      2015. This event is now in its fifth year and was made
      possible through a generous grant from Zoetis. It not
      only features research posters but typically also hosts a
      keynote speaker during this very social gathering.
      Poster setup, registration and mingling began at 5 PM.
      Over 70 people enjoyed the atmosphere of this public
      event; 51% of the attendees were ACS members.
    </p>

    The audience was excited to learn about the latest efforts to
    control and cure malaria from the keynote speaker. At 7 pm
    Dr. Karson S. Putt began his seminar, which was titled "Inhibition
    of an erythrocyte tyrosine.  kinase prevents Plasmodium falciparum
    egress and terminates parasitemia". In his role as Managing
    Director, Putt oversees over 110 faculty members and over 600
    students at the Purdue University Center for Drug
    Discovery. During the presentation he explained how inhibition of
    a specific enzyme can arrest malaria. This is a breakthrough
    finding.  According to the World Health Organization, one child
    dies from malaria every minute, and half of the world’s population
    remains at risk of infection.  Because this threat is expected to
    rise as drug resistance continues to eliminate established
    treatment options, the search for novel anti-malarial therapies
    has intensified. There are over 200 million infections of malaria
    every year, which is endemic in Africa, South and Central America,
    and South East Asia.

  The original speaker for this event was Kristina Kesely. However,
  just 9 days before her visit to Kalamazoo she received word that
  human trial studies in Vietnam were approved by the Vietnamese
  Ministry of Health and Purdue IRB. Within less than a week's notice
  Kesely and her team had to prepare for a month-long visit to South
  East Asia to gather data for their novel therapy. This was an
  exciting development but it also meant that someone else needed to
  fill in for her. Organizers were happy to learn that Putt could step
  in on short notice.
</p>
<p>
  Event visitors had a chance to enjoy hot appetizers and beer from 5
  to 9 pm while listening to the keynote speech and reviewing the
  posters that were given by scientists from Kalamazoo College,
  Michigan State University, Western Michigan University, and
  Zoetis. There were 21 new or "recycled" (from a previous conference)
  posters, including a total of 15 student presenters. This year,
  there were also three cash prizes drawn from poster presenters who
  submitted their abstracts by November 4. The winners were Basil
  Ahmed, Wisam A. Alisawi and Harry Chanzu.
