<h1 id="chemluminary">2020 - A Virtual ChemLuminary Awards Celebration</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia E. M. Hines, KACS Councilor and Outreach coordinator</p>

    <p>
      Each year at the Fall ACS meeting a Tuesday night is devoted to a
      very exuberant gathering of members, associated with the
      announcement of awards given by 23 committees of the ACS to
      individuals and groups within the ACS for achievements of many
      sorts, either during the previous year, or over many years. It is
      preceded with a spread of hors d’oeuvres courtesy of the ACS and a
      presentation of posters displaying pictures of recognition-worthy
      activities done by finalists selected from nominations submitted by
      local sections (through their Annual Reports), or from individual
      members who nominate others whose accomplishments are deemed
      noteworthy (according to rubrics and applications which may be found
      on the ACS website). Following the review of the posters and
      enjoyment of the food the celebration moves to a separate decorated
      hall where finalists are announced – with pictures shown on a big
      screen of the achievements which earned them that status – and the
      winner recognized with a plaque (ChemLuminary Award); each awardee
      is appropriately cheered (clapping and yelling) by the audience.

<p><strong>We were selected as a finalist for an award for
    outstanding performance for a section of our size.</strong></p>

<p>
  It had been several years since our Section had won an award for its
  efforts, and after a couple of years of not nominating ourselves
  through our Annual Report, we did so for our 2019 activities and
  were informed that we had been selected as a <strong>finalist for an
    award from the LSAC (Local Section Activities Committee) for
    outstanding performance for a section of our size</strong> (Medium
  Small: 200-399 members); on the day of the Award Celebration we
  found out that our competitor sections were the Dayton and the
  Savannah River Sections.
</p>

<p>
  Since there was no in-person meeting in San Francisco in the fall of
  2020, the ACS staff developed a virtual ChemLuminary celebration,
  which was widely publicized and happened at 4 pm on December 9,
  2020; in place of the excited clapping and yelling described above
  there was a <b>chat box</b> which was full of scrolling
  congratulatory comments commending finalists and winners. Excitement
  was high when the three finalists in our category were named, and
  our activities for 2019 were memorable &ndash;
  (see <a href="#chemluminary-events">sample list below</a>) &ndash;
  but when the winner was announced, that section was Dayton &ndash;
  disappointing, yes, yet exciting to have been selected as a
  finalist!

  KACS did have a winner mentioned during the ceremony: The second

  of the Helen M. Free Award for Public Outreach.

      In June of
      2020 <a href="/newsletter/2020/06/30/june-newsletter.html#project-seed"
	      title="KACS June newsletter">we wrote that ACS canceled in-person research
	opportunities</a> for Project SEED due to the COVID pandemic
      and provided an alternative, four- week Virtual Summer Camp
      experience that included small and large group learning and
      presentation activities. Many students were supplied with
      computers and internet connection devices to help them
      participate. One of two applicants from our section was
      selected to participate at no cost to our local chapter. It
      was an impressive adaptation to the challenges at the time
      and, by all reports, a significant success for ACS. Of the 300
      students selected, 291 completed the program. Surveys suggest
      that students were favorably influenced to pursue additional
      studies in science. The most popular sessions were a research
      presentation on vaccines for opioid addiction, a webinar on
      ethics in science and a panel discussion on the transition
      from high school to college.

<p>
  Much pandemic uncertainty remains in 2021. ACS plans to reintroduce
  in-person research options this year, if possible, and expects to
  make a go/no go decision on this key element by February 1. If this
  is approved, I will be reaching out immediately to our recent
  project host sites for proposals. This will require a quick
  turn-around, so please think ahead about possibilities
  and <a href="/people/williams.html"
	 title="Doug Williams contact information">contact me</a> if you are interested
  in, or just curious about, serving as a mentor in Summer
  2021. Secondly, ACS will again offer virtual programming again at no
  direct cost to local sections and with preference given to
  applicants who are not able to participate in the in-person
  programs, if available.

      Although we are budgeted locally for up to two in-person Project
      SEED fellowships this year (about $1500 per student), we are always
      hopeful to expand. We turned several students away in 2019 and
      expect at least 5-10 applications again this year. If you feel so

<h1 id="glrm-info">2021 Great Lakes Regional Meeting Information</h1>

  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      The Great Lakes Region of the ACS, of which Kalamazoo Section is a
      part, holds Regional Meetings every other odd-numbered year, as
      member sections offer to host or co-host a meeting in their
      geographic area (the last meeting in which our section played a
      major role was in May of 2015 in Grand Rapids; we and the Western
      MI section (a member of the Central Region and head-quartered in
      Grand Rapids were co-hosts). Regional meetings often present
      symposia, plenary lectures, an exposition, career resources,
      poster sessions/flash talks, award gatherings etc. in an effort to
      present a variety of events to our members.
