    <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
    <p>
      KACS held its final event of the year on November 1, when more
      than 200 people visited the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts to attend
      “Chemistry & Culture: Elements of Dance”. A brief summary has been
      included in this newsletter and an extended report will be made
      available online.  Our next event will be in January, titled
      Chemistry & Culture: Food – Sense-ational Molecules in
      Nutrition”. Details will be announced soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On December 31, 2013, I will bow out as KACS Chair. Dr.  John
      Engelmann will take over for 2014 and I wish him best of luck as
      he oversees upcoming activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last two years it has been a pleasure to work with local
      area chemists. I appreciate the work put forward by every
      volunteer and was pleased to see so many participants at our
      events. I would like to give special thanks to all the Local
      Section officers and four local chemistry student groups: the
      ChemClubs at Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University
      (WMU), the WMU Chemistry Graduate Student Association (CGSA) and
      the WMU Chapter of the National Organization for the Professional
      Advancement of Black Chemist and Chemical Engineers
      (NOBCChE). Lastly, our events would not have been successful
      without collaborators and donors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will continue to volunteer for KACS as Past-Chair and will work
      with two new members in 2014: Dr. Brian Eklov (Chair- Elect) and
      Angela Willson (Secretary). Please stay in touch with KACS, I hope
      to see you in 2014 and wish you a Happy New Year!

    <p>
      As the Chairman of the Kalamazoo section for 2014 I would like
      to take this opportunity to introduce myself and tell you about
      some of the Section activities for 2014. I am John Engelmann and
      have been a member of the ACS for many years. I did my
      undergraduate work at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, and
      I got my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Section Councilor, Lydia Hines, and I were at the University
      of Illinois at the same time and actually worked in labs close
      together. After a number of years of going our own ways we now
      find ourselves working together in the Kalamazoo Section of the
      ACS!
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my love for chemistry I have always been
      interested in law. I got my law degree from the University of
      Illinois and found a way to combine my interests by becoming an
      Intellectual Property attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a number of interesting Section activities lined up for
      2014: Our January meeting will relate to food chemistry, with
      samples. In early April we are having the High School Science
      Symposium and later that month we have a small outreach in
      connection with Chemists Celebrate Earth Day. We supervise a
      competitive exam, and in May we have the Awards Gathering where
      high school teachers and students and others are recognized for
      their educational and volunteer activities. In June we will
      anticipate participating in the WMU Chemistry Graduate Student
      picnic. In October, as part of National Chemistry Week, we have
      a Saturday afternoon (Chemistry Day) at the Kalamazoo Valley
      Museum, an event in which we reach out to the community to
      encourage an interest in chemistry. Once again Zoetis is
      supporting a poster session, in October or November, where
      members can exhibit posters displaying their work – it is a
      wonderful way to discover the great diversity of work being done
      by chemists of our Section. In addition to these events we will
      have meetings where we invite speakers on various topics, so
      stay tuned. You will receive meeting announcements as the date
      of each event approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please accept my personal invitation to attend some or all of
      these events, and introduce yourself to me; I look forward to
      meeting you. Greater participation makes for greater enthusiasm
      at each meeting. I would welcome any suggestions for other
      chemistry-related events you would like to see in our Section,
      so please contact me at

<h1>KACS Elections</h1>

<p class="author">Elke Schoffers</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>
  KACS could not have accomplished much without the efforts of its
  volunteers. That is why I would like to thank Carolyn Pugh who has
  served as Secretary over the last two years. I herewith welcome two
  new Executive Committee officers beginning January 2014, Dr.  Brian
  Eklov (Chair-Elect) and Angela Willson (Secretary). Below please
  find additional information
</p>

<h2>Brian Eklov, Ph.D. – KACS Chair-Elect</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-{{ site.device }}-8">
    <p>
      Dr. Eklov received a B.S. in Chemistry with honors from the
      University of Michigan in 1998, and a Ph.D. from the University
      of Minnesota in 2005 (T. R. Hoye). After post-doctoral studies
      at the University of Illinois (S. E. Denmark), he joined the
      staff at Kalexsyn as a research chemist in 2007, and is
      currently associate director of chemistry. During his time at
      Kalexsyn, he has led a large team of scientists in
      acollaboration with a major pharmaceutical company to search for
      inhibitors of mTor. He also is collaborating with a major
      chemical supplier to develop chemistry that enables academic
      discoveries to be translated into marketable reagents.

<h2>Angela Willson – KACS Secretary</h2>
<p>
  Angela Willson may be a new WMU Graduate Teaching Assistant and
  student pursuing her Masters in Chemistry and PhD in Science
  Education through the Mallinson Institute for Science Education, but
  she is not a stranger to Kalamazoo nor the ACS. Angela was born and
  raised in the Kalamazoo area and attended Portage Northern High
  School. She then went on to attend Saint Mary's College and received
  her Bachelor of Science in Chemistry in 2012. At Saint Mary's
  College, Angela acted as co-President of the Saint Mary's
  Affiliation of the American Chemical Society (SMAACS). She then
  spent a year in Minneapolis, MN working in food science with
  Cargill. Most recently she has spent time in the area attending KACS
  events and volunteering for Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley
  Museum.

<h1>Report</h1>
<h2>Chemistry &amp; Culture: Elements of Dance 2013</h2>

<p>
  The connection between chemistry and culture, especially chemistry
  and dance may not be obvious to everybody. However, there are some
  interesting aspects to consider when contemplating these
  combinations.
  <a href="http://www.johnbohannon.org" title="John Bohannon homepage">
    John Bohannon</a>, a biologist and science journalist, has
  collaborated with AAAS to create the “Dance Your PhD”
  competition. It is in response to a dreaded situation that
  scientists encounter whey they try to explain their research to
  laymen. How does one respond to “So, what’s your PhD about?” For the
  fourth year running, PhD scientists can compete to win up to $1,000,
  and they are required to dance. Bohannon has also performed at
  <a href="http://www.tedxbrussels.eu/" title="TEDx Brussels Website">
    TEDx Brussels</a>. With the help of the Black Label Movement dance
  troupe he proposed to replace Powerpoint software with live
  dancers. Zafra M. Lerman of the <em>Institute for Science Education
  and Science Communication</em> thinks that the “arts can play a
  valuable role in reversing [a negative] public perception” and help
  “improve the public understanding of chemistry” (“CHEMISTRY: AN
  INSPIRATION FOR THEATRE AND DANCE” <em>Chemical Education
  International, Vol. 6, No. 1, 2005</em>). A notable example is the
  play “Oxygen”, written by Carl Djerassi and Nobel laureate Roald
  Hoffmann. And “Nobel laureate John Planyi has referred to molecular
  movement as ‘the dance of the molecules’”.
</p>
<p>
  On November 1, over 200 people were curious enough to find out about
  "dancing chemists" when KACS connected "atoms and molecules to
  exercise science" in the lobby, while offering showcase dances, line
  dances and open dances in the auditorium of the Kalamazoo Institute
  of Arts during "Chemistry and Culture: Elements of Dance". Mayor
  Bobby Hopewell was the "Surprise Celebrity MC".
</P>
<p>
  Many chemists dressed in elegant evening attire and joined local
  ballroom dancers and the general public. The lobby featured
  refreshments and several displays as part of an exhibit that
  explained exercise chemistry:
  <ul>
    <li>Amino Acids, Peptides, Proteins, and Endorphins</li>
    <li>Doping in Sports</li>
    <li>Steroids</li>
    <li>Chemicals Used in Sports Attire</li>
    <li>Chemistry, Body Odor and Pheromones</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Participants were able to win prizes. For example, correct crossword
  puzzles, based on the science in the exhibit, were entered into a
  drawing for trial gym memberships, T-shirts, Meg-A- Moles, and dance
  passes, among others.
</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-{{ site.device }}-9">
  <p>
    There was also a computer set up which played a YouTube video of
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg54Tp85S-Y"
       title="ACS Dancing Video on Youtube"> “Chemists Can DANCE! The
      first ever dancing periodic table of elements”
    </a>, which was produced by ACS. A demo showed how one can isolate
    iron from cereal. Last but not least, there was a display as a
    special tribute to Dr. Alfred Bader, founder of Aldrich Chemicals
    and an avid art collector and philanthropist. This event was made
    possible through generous donations by AAAS, WMU, Aldrich
    Chemistry, Alfred Bader Fine Arts, and WMU-BTR. It was also a
    collaboration of KACS with the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts,
    Southwest Michigan Ballroom Dance and the Kalamazoo Chapter of USA
    Dance.

<h1>A Report on Kalamazoo College Mole Day 2013</h1>
<p class="author">Amanda Bolles</p>
<p>
  We are very happy to report a recent successful Chemistry Club
  outreach on our campus: In an effort to promote chemistry and
  membership in Kalamazoo College’s Chem Club, a <em>Mole Day
  Event</em> was held in the Dow Science building on <em>October 23,
  2013</em>. Over fifty students participated in the activities, which
  included mole jokes, donuts, fun mole facts, and mole-related games.
  This was an opportunity for chemistry and biology majors to
  socialize and learn more about the Chemistry Club, as well as
  explore future activities. Thirty students took a guess at how any
  moles of glucose were in a graduated cylinder full of candy – the
  winner’s guess was within 2 moles of the correct number! As a bonus,
  <strong>the Chem Club gained 5 members!</strong>
</p>
