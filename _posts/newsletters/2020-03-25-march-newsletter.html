<h1 id="chair-message">Welcome KACS Chair Elect Edward W. Thomas</h1>

Please welcome new Chair Elect for the KACS, Edward W. Thomas,
Ph.D. He would like to share the following greetings with the
Kalamazoo American Chemical Society membersn:

<blockquote>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p>
      I am pleased to serve as the 2020 Chair-Elect and 2021 Chair of
      the Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical Society. I have
      over 35 years of pharmaceutical research and development
      experience and have been a member of ACS for 47 years. With all
      the benefits I have received from the ACS, I decided it was time
      to give back. In the past I have given demonstrations at
      Chemistry Day and visited local elementary schools to share with
      them the excitement of science and chemistry. Last year I was
      super-charged by our local section receiving the prestigious ACS
      National Historic Chemistry Landmark Award. I especially
      enjoyed the chemistry symposium on the day of the award, May 17,
      2019, and the social event and dinner the previous evening. I
      wish to continue with the local committee to implement
      interesting scientific member meetings.
    </p>

<p>
  Membership enjoyment and participation, scientific meetings and
  education are my foci for this year. I hope you share with me, or
  other executive committee members, your interests and needs.  Please
  feel free to <a href="/people/thomas.html">contact me</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to helping the Kalamazoo ACS section achieve Hershel
  Jude's and our local section's goals through successful activities
  and increased membership participation.

<h1 id="milwood-outreach">Science Fun Outreach to Kalamazoo's Milwood
  Elementary</h1>

<p class="author">By Andrew Simpkins</p>

<p>
  A group of Western Michigan Chemistry Club members went to Milwood
  Elementary schools to present five different experiments to 4th
  graders on Friday, February 7 th , 2020. Those experiments included
  two dealing with pressure, one dealing with polarities, one dealing
  with making slime, and last being elephant toothpaste. The two
  dealing with pressure was putting something hot into something that
  was cold either crushing a pop can or pulling up cold water through
  an upside down erlenmeyer flask.  Some things to make sure you do to
  ensure safety for those experiment's and the success of it would be
  to wear goggles, making sure there is water in the pop can or flask,
  using a hot plate so others around the experimenter are safe, have
  cold water or ice, have protective clothing, wear gloves, and an
  oven mit of some sort so you don't burn your hand on the
  transfer. The polarity experiment dealt with acetone and a styrofoam
  cup, which showed the kids that "like dissolves like". Some things
  to make sure of one's safety is to wear goggles, gloves, and have a
  big beaker so the risk of the acetone splashing on the experimenter
  and/or the observers, when it's being poured on the cup, is
  lessened. We also tried to make connections to everyday things they
  may have used before like nail polish remover for example.

<p>
  On March 10, we were treated to a presentation of specially-paired
  foods and beers of Latitude 42 Brewing Company at their Oshtemo
  location on West Main St. Twenty local members and guests registered
  to attend and hear Mike Babb's description of the beer styles and
  flavor attributes that made them suitable for each selected food
  item. Doug Williams gave a short description of Project SEED, the
  ACS summer research program for disadvantaged high school
  students. And, we continued to give out special pint glasses and
  wallet cards to commemorate 2019 as the International Year of the
  Periodic Table (IYPT). This was our third IYPT celebration event
  since last year, all sponsored by an ACS Innovative Program
  Grant. If you missed them, keep an eye out for us at future
  activities. We still have more glasses and cards to give away. You
  can also make donations directly to our local Project SEED fund at
  our PayPal donation page. See our
  <a href="/grants/#project-seed" title="Project SEED page">Project
  SEED page</a> for more information. Donations of any amount are
  greatly appreciated.

<h1 id="covid-19">
  KACS Calendar for Spring and Summer
</h1>

<p>
  Due to the COVID-19 world-wide pandemic, Michigan have been
  modified, postponed or cancelled. Our section's Executive Committee
  met on March 17, by video conference call, and the following
  <strong>schedule modifications</strong> were decided at that time:
</p>
<p>
  Participation in the April Earth Day-related KACS activities usually
  staffed by members and students in our college-affiliated chemistry
  clubs have been canceled.
</p>
<p>
  The spring Awards gathering for recipients of ACS multi-year
  membership certificates, recipients of awards recognizing
  outstanding achievement in chemistry in their college and high
  school education etc. has been canceled; the awardees will receive
  their awards by mail and will be recognized through publicity in our
  KACS newsletter.
</p>
<p>
  KACS participation by way of offering a water-stop during the
  Borgess Marathon currently scheduled for May 3rd is under
  consideration. The marathon organizers have yet to decide on whether
  or not the 2020 run will take place (NEWS FLASH:
  the <a href="https://thekalamazoomarathon.com/">Marathon has been
  canceled</a>).
</p>
<p>
  The Executive Committee will continue to meet monthly via a video
  conference until such time as it is deemed safe to resume normal
  activities.
</p>
