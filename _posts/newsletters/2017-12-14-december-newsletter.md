      This was a bit of rough year, 2017, what with the hurricanes,
      earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, ridiculous politics and
      politicians, and the shameful and horrendous acts of
      violence. But some worthwhile events did occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the world of chemistry the IUPAC approved this year four new
      chemical element names. Now for the first time in quite a while
      all the existing rows in the periodic table are filled. And all
      elements in the table, currently 118 of them, have names. KACS
      felt this occasion deserved recognition, so teamed up with the
      people of Kalamazoo to celebrate. That celebration was captured
      in an eight minute, twenty-four second movie that can be viewed
      below. Check it out, a definite affirmation that love of
      chemistry is alive and well in Kalamazoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also this year, KACS participated in multiple Kalamazoo Earth
      Day events, including the local March for Science. KACS also
      celebrated National Chemistry Week with our annual K Valley
      Museum Day, which was very well attended. The KACS annual
      Recycled Poster Event in Bell's Back Room continued its run
      again this year as a most popular local science event. KACS
      co-hosted with Kalamazoo College this year a very successful
      Speed Networking Event for local chemistry college
      students. KACS also put together and submitted a successful ACS
      National Historic Chemical Landmark nomination, recognizing the
      steroid chemistry work of Kalamazoo Upjohn Company scientists
      spanning 1950-1990. And of course we celebrated the 75 th
      anniversary of KACS this year.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, contrary to the many world events that occurred,
      this was a very non-disastrous, successful year for KACS. Well
      done Kalamazoo American Chemical Society Local Section. Happy
      holidays, happy new year, and let's continue the good work in
      2018.

<h1 id="election-results">KACS Election Results</h1>

<p>Here are the results from this year's local section officer election:</p>

<p><strong>Angela Willson</strong> - re-elected as Secretary for a
  two-year term.
</p>
<p><strong>Bill Schinzer</strong> - elected as Treasurer to carry out
  the remaining year of the current two-year term.
</p>
<p><strong>Lydia Hines</strong> - re-elected as Councilor for a
  three-year term
</p>
<p>
  The open Chair-Elect and Chair positions had some write-in
  nominations, but none that were willing to serve.
</p>
<p>
  As a post-election note, Luke Chadwick stepped up willing to take
  the 2018 Chair-Elect position. Look for a profile on Luke in a
  future newsletter.
</p>
<p>
  So, for 2018, KACS officers will be:

<h1>Report - KACS Speed Networking</h1>
<p>
  On the evening of 10 October at the K College Hicks Student Center,
  the Kalamazoo College Chemistry Department and Career Planning
  Office cohosted with KACS, a speed networking event for area
  chemistry college students. The purpose of the event was to connect
  local chemistry college students (K College, WMU, KVCC) with local
  working chemists (KACS members serving as mentors) for information
  sharing.
</p>
<p>
  The event set up was like that for speed dating, with participating
  students rotating through 5- minute face-to-face time with
  participating mentors. The students asked questions related to
  establishing and building chem-related careers and the mentors
  provided answers and information based on personal experience. The
  evening ended with refreshments and time for free-style follow-up
  interaction between the students and mentors. KACS provided prizes
  for the participants including some randomly awarded ACS student
  memberships (paid for via grant money provided by ACS).
</p>
<p>
  Event feedback from mentors and students alike was highly positive,
  with the event considered a valuable and worth-while success. Jackie
  Srodes from the K College Career Planning Office summarized: "What a
  FANTASTIC event last evening for the area college students and
  members of the Kalamazoo American Chemical Society that served as
  mentors!!" Jeff Bartz, Chair of the Kalamazoo College Chemistry
  Department added: "I've had several students stop and thank me for
  the event. Thank you to everyone involved!" The organizers agreed
  that we would like to see this become an annual event.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks to the KACS members that served as mentors: Ashok Patel,
  Beth Nagash, Bill Schinzer, Brian Eklov, Brianna Galli, Bridget
  Lorenz Lemberg, Charissa Oliphant, Chris Pruis, Dave Erdman, Denis
  Billen, Derek Sheehan, Doug Williams, Jana Deering, John Manski,
  Julie Lorenz, Mara Birndorf, Rachel Wilson, Susan Sheehan, Tim
  Johnson, Tom Mulhern, Val Vaillancourt.
</p>
<p>
  Photos show the excellent student-mentor engagement the event
  achieved.

<h1 id="student-reception">Report - Student Reception</h1>
<p>
  On 28 October KACS threw a reception for the Kalamazoo chemistry
  student chapters, at the Kalamazoo Curling Club. The purpose of the
  event was to say thanks to the WMU Chemistry Graduate Student
  Association (CGSA), the WMU Chem Club and the Kalamazoo College Chem
  Club for their community outreach work. A big part of what makes the
  annual KACS events like Chemists Celebrate Earth Day and Chemistry
  Day at the Museum successful, is the demonstrations and volunteer
  work done by the student chapters.
</p>
<p>
  The reception involved an opportunity to try the sport of curling,
  followed by refreshments, with KACS providing some ACS student
  memberships as prizes (paid for with ACS grant money). Many thanks
  to the Kalamazoo Curling Club member volunteers for getting us out
  on the ice. Photos show that a very fun time was had by all.

<h1 id="lab-coats">Update - Lab Coat Initiative</h1>

<p>
  Earlier this year KACS received Innovative Grant money from ACS to
  purchase lab coats labelled with our KACS logo. The purpose of this
  initiative is to have lab coats available for use by KACS members
  and local chemistry students, providing needed lab personal
  protection equipment, and providing a mechanism for promoting KACS
  and instilling a sense of identity for KACS members.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some photos of the lab coats in action:

<h1 id="museum-day">Report - National Chemistry Week Event</h1>

<p>
  Unlike other years' beautiful October weather on our Chemistry Days,
  this year the 14<sup>th</sup> of October was an unusually rainy and
  cool day in Kalamazoo. An enthusiastic group of 60+ volunteers - 15
  ACS members, 5 ACS student members and 40 students or other
  colleagues from 2 high schools and 3 local colleges and several
  industries, etc. - gathered to present 25 separate hands-on
  activities and demonstrations and to hand out resources to over 1000
  attendees at our much-anticipated 31<sup>st</sup> 4-hour event at
  the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, the venue which has graciously been our
  host for this event for the past 30 years. Publicity had been sent
  to K-12 teachers and to other public venues by e-mail and social
  media, and through the medium of TV to the broader community in SW
  Michigan, and even to the northern Indiana border by friends of
  friends who learned of it through the museum's and our
  announcements! Given the theme of this year's event, <em>Chemistry
  Rocks!</em> colleagues from the Kalamazoo Geological and Mineral
  Society joined us, and they presented some of their displays and
  talked to the patrons regarding how chemistry and geology are
  intertwined.
</p>
<p>
  Below are three pictures of favorite activities: Elephant
  Toothpaste, Slime, and Oobleck.

<h2>National Chemistry Week Event</h2>

<p>
  Hi KACS!
</p>
<p>
  We had a wonderful night​ at our second Lake Center Elementary
  "I&lt;3 STEM" night​ on November 30, 2017. We estimate that there
  were over 800 people and I'm not counting the number of students in
  attendance. There ​seems to have been a balanced distribution of
  attendance across the 5 - 11 year old range. It's rumored that some
  of the public heard and came to check it out too. ​ This is an event
  we hope to do again.... as it went SUPER well <em>Big Shout
  outs</em> to ​the ​Kalamazoo ​Section of the American ​Chemi​cal Society
  for ​​providing ​booklets and ​funding for our event. ​With your support
  we were able to purchase needed materials​, and ​the ​Celebrating
  Chemistry ​booklets were given out in handle bags, ​along with trading
  cards that featured STEM professionals. ​The WMU ChemClub table
  (picture included below) ​helped the children make slime and ​change
  copper pennies to "silver or gold" ​pennies.
</p>
<p>
  On behalf of the Lake Center PTO​, the students, staff and families,
  thank-you!
</p>
<p>
  Sincerely,<br />
  Stephanie Norg<br />
  STEM event organizer<br />

<h1 id="national-meeting-report">Trip Report - 254<sup>th</sup> ACS National Meeting</h1>

<p class="author">
  Gabe Kornis' (50+ yr ACS member) gives his personal impressions from
  the 254th ACS National Meeting, August 20-24, 2017, Washington DC.
</p>

<h3>Organic Chemistry</h3>
<h4>Robert Burns Woodward Centennial Symposium</h4>
<p>
  For those of us who are old enough, and had the pleasure of
  attending the 2 to 4 hour lectures given by RB Woodward and admiring
  the structures drawn with multi colored chalks on a black board,
  this Symposium was an emotional experience.
</p>
<p>
  
<p>
  The ACS historian, Jeffrey Seeman, showed many original hand written
  letters, notes, photographs, the iconic blue tie, etc., retrieved
  from the Harvard archives. Also present were the two Woodward
  children, now in their forties.  Crystal Woodward, his daughter, who
  is an artist, gave a talk on the elegance and beauty of Woodward's
  structures and growing up in a household where chemistry was king.
</p>
<p>
  Also contributing to the symposium was Sarah Reisman from Cal Tech,
  a new star in the field of natural product synthesis.  She described
  the synthesis of polyhydroxylated diterpenoids, such as ryanodol and
  ryanodine, as well as some alkaloids.  Some of the novel techniques
  she applied were nickel catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross
  coupling, concise synthesis through straight oxidation, and the
  coupling of smaller intermediates, instead of straight linear
  synthesis.
</p>

<h4>C-H Activation</h4>
<p>
  continues to be of major interest in both academic and industrial
  labs. The traditional methods utilized are by directing group
  assisted activation, base mediated metalation, or free radicals.
</p>
<p>
  A novel approach presented is C-H activation via deprotonative
  zincation applied selectively to numerous heterocycles. Benzoyl
  hydroxylamine was used for the introduction of amines and the azide
  group into non activated arenes.
</p>
<p>
  Corinna Schindler from the University of Michigan described the use
  of iron(III) catalysts for carbonyl - olefin ring closing metathesis
  to form 5- and 6- membered carbocycles, in contrast to Grub's olefin
  - olefin metathesis.
</p>
<p>
  A novel selective alkene hydrosilylation catalyzed by
  bis(amino)amide nickel complexes is highly efficacious with turnover
  numbers of up to 10,000. Many functional groups are tolerated in the
  process.
</p>
<h4>High throughput experimentation</h4>
<p>
  for industrial and academic applications was discussed by Melodie
  Christensen, MerckResearch & Development. While originally developed
  for the discovery of biologically active compounds, it is now widely
  used for reaction optimization. High throughput experimentation was
  successfully applied to enantioselective syntheses, identification
  of the ideal catalyst, Suzuki - Miyaura cross coupling reactions,
  and to minimize byproduct formation.
</p>

<h3>Medicinal Chemistry</h3>
<h4>Chronic Neuropathic Pain</h4>
<p>
  was the topic for a full morning session. Well over 15 million
  people in the US suffer chronic pain, and novel, selective
  medications are urgently needed.  Adenosine is known to exert potent
  analgesia in animal models of neuropathic pain, and in limited
  clinical trials, in humans.  Recent studies have shown that
  adenosine reduces pain through the A3AR target, and that some A3AR
  agonists decrease neuropathic pain in models, without analgesic
  tolerance or side effects from opioid and endocannabinoid based
  drugs. A number of A3AR agonists for clinical developments have been
  discovered, but their names or structures were not divulged.
</p>
<p>
  Northwestern University workers have utilized the 4 -
  endocannabinoid system as a target for neuropathic pain treatment. A
  number of cannabinergic ligands with good binding and functional
  properties were discovered which lacked undesirable CNS activities.
  While Lyrica, the present gold standard for neuropathic pain, does
  suffer of delayed activity, two of the ligands discovered did not.
  When injected via a mini-pump long term relief was observed.
</p>
<p>
  Bristol Myers Squibb researchers utilized adaptor associated kinase
  1 (AAK1), as a new therapeutic target for neuropathic pain. AAK1
  knock-out mice exhibited reduced pain behavior and a reduced
  neuropathic pain response. 5 - Benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridin-5(6H)-one
  and 5H-chromeno[3,4-c]pyridine were identified as a possible
  treatment for neuropathic pain .
</p>

<h4>Chagas disease</h4>
<p>
  or trypanosomiasis is an infection caused by the parasite
  Trypanosoma cruzid. It is widely spread in South America and it is
  estimated that over 2 million people suffer from this disease. No
  drugs have been approved by the FDA due to serious side effects.
  Based on X-ray structure analysis, a potent inhibitor named VNI was
  found effective in mice infected with Tulahuen strain of T. cruzi.
  Using this structural information, another candidate named VFV was
  identified. It has no toxicity, good bioavailability, and it is not
  a mutagen. Clinical trials are planned for the near future.
</p>
<h4>Resistant Hypertension.</h4>
<p>
  There are about 76 million people in the US who have hypertension.
  Minorities of these patients do not respond to any of the
  medications approved by the FDA, and risk heart failure, or other
  related diseases.
</p>
<p>
  Aldosterone promotes increased blood pressure. Its biosynthesis is
  catalyzed by several enzymes including CYP11B2. Small molecule
  inhibitors of CYP11B2 lower aldosterone concentration and decrease
  high blood pressure. Researchers at Merck and related organizations
  synthesized a number of compounds which are CYP11B2 inhibitors.
  LCI699, the lead candidate, displayed potent and selective
  inhibition of CYP11B2, dose dependent lowering of aldosterone, good
  pharmacokinetic properties in the rat and monkey, and good physical
  properties.
</p>
