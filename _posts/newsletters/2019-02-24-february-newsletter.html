<h1 id="chair-message">Words from our new KACS Chair</h1>
<p class="caption">By Dr. Lucas Chadwick</p>

<p>
  As a long-time ACS fan-boy I am honored to be the 2019 chair of the
  Kalamazoo Section. We all have an information flood of epic
  proportions bombarding us almost every waking minute.  While the
  street value of high-quality information is at an all-time low (due
  to an historic oversupply of low-quality information), ACS hasn't
  flinched and continues to crank out some of the top journals and
  most reliable information in the world. It is particularly
  satisfying in these times to be affiliated with an organization
  synonymous with world-class technical content, and amazing career
  resources and assistance are also major attractions of ACS
  membership. It is truly remarkable how KACS' volunteers have kept
  this organization running. To be welcomed onto this amazing team is
  humbling.
</p>
<p>
  Chemical education has long been a core objective of KACS. In its
  heyday, the KACS Education Committee was an organization in and of
  itself, with dozens of members actively engaged in various
  initiatives and subcommittees. Fast forward to today, the KACS
  Education Committee needs to be revitalized! If we don't have an
  educator heading up the education committee by the time chair-elect
  Hershel Jude takes over, I will have failed him. I love to hear any
  and all ideas on how to make KACS relevant and useful to chemical
  educators in our area and how best to sustain KACS' roots in
  chemical education.
</p>
<p>
  The KACS website has a fresh
  look, <a href="/" title="KACS homepage">

  kalamazooacs.org a primary resource for all-things-chemistry in
  Kalamazoo.

<p>
  As this icy winter continues, I look forward to spring, and wish
  everyone a very productive 2019. If you can only make it out for one
  KACS event this year, I'd recommend the <a href="/event/2019/05/16/chemistry-landmark-dedication.html" title="Dedication event page">Kalamazoo National

<p>
  On Nov. 13, 2018, the Kalamazoo section of the American Chemical
  Society (KACS) hosted its 8 th annual poster session titled
  <em>Sustainable Science - Recycle a Poster</em> at Bell's Eccentric
  Caf&eacute; in downtown Kalamazoo. This is a public event made possible
  through a generous grant from Zoetis, and this year it attracted
  over 100 attendees of whom approximately 58% were ACS members.
</p>
<p>
  The keynote speaker was Dr. Katie Whalen, Principal Scientist and
  Team Lead Biotechnology &amp; Food Protection R&amp;D at Kalsec,
  Inc., who presented a very engaging talk entitled <em>Digging for
  Gold in Your Own Backyard: Novel Enzymes for Use in Flavors &
  Fragrances</em> during which she informed on how one proceeds to
  discover novel enzyme needles in a haystack that grows by 5 million
  every month.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the keynote speech, there was a poster session with
  23 posters, 70% of which had students identified as major
  contributors to the research. Attendees enjoyed hot appetizers and
  beer from 5 to 9 pm while listening to the keynote speech, mingling,
  and reviewing the displays. Posters highlighted work from Zoetis,
  Bell's Brewery, Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University
  (WMU), among others.
</p>
<p>
  Students who submitted a poster abstract by an announced early
  deadline had the opportunity to win a $50 cash prize. This year's
  winners were Zach Whitacre, Nicole Burke and Troy deHagen. They
  presented the following posters:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>From Agriculture to Prairie: Microbial Restoration
	Efforts</em> <strong>Zachary Whitacre</strong>, Jacob Evans,
	Mitchell Patalon, and Kathryn Docherty* Department of
	Biological Sciences, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo,
	MI
      </em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>The effects of climate change-related forest disturbance on terpene concentrations of
	white pine (Pinus strobus) and red pine (Pinus resinosa)</em>
      <strong>Troy deHagen</strong>, Dr. Steven Bertman, Dr. Dave
      Karowe* Department of Biological Sciences, Western Michigan
      University, Kalamazoo, MI
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Profiling of Alkylresorcinol Content in Whole Grains Using LC-MS</em>
      <strong>Nicole L. Burke</strong>*, Russell W. LaClair Global
      Chemistry Department, W.K. Kellogg Institute for Food and
      Nutrition Research, Battle Creek, MI
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The KACS Executive Committee is grateful for the financial support
  that Zoetis has provided since the event's debut to help defray the
  expenses associated with it and the help by many volunteers.

<h1 id="chair-elect">Meet Hershel Jude – KACS Chair-Elect</h1>

<p>
  I grew up in Eastern Kentucky and received a B.A. in chemistry from
  Berea College in Berea, Kentucky where I served as president of the
  Berea College Student ACS chapter. I earned a M.S. and Ph.D. in
  Chemistry from the University of Cincinnati with Professor William
  B. Connick, where my research focused on the synthesis and
  characterization of two-electron platinum reagents. After graduate
  school, I spent two years as a post-doctoral associate at the
  University of Utah with Professor Peter J. Stang and three years as
  a Post-Doctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Lab with Dr. Reginaldo
  Rocha. While in Professor Stang's group, my research focused on the
  development and characterization of two- and three-dimensional
  supramolecular assemblies and while working with Dr. Rocha I
  developed ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts for the oxidation of
  water. In 2008, I moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan and joined Kalsec as
  a lead scientist where I currently focus on developing new hop
  products and processes for the brewing industry.

    <p>
      I live in Kalamazoo township with my wife and two children (10
      and 7). In my free time, I enjoy bowling, camping, biking and
      reading. I am very passionate about the ACS and what it offers
      it members, particularly the education and career components. My
      adventures with the ACS started with my first oral presentation
      late on Thursday afternoon at a national meeting in Washington,
      D.C. That 20-minute talk, which lasted 10 minutes due to being
      nervous and speaking so fast, was a great learning
      experience. An interview at the 2008 National Meeting in New
      Orleans led to me relocating to Kalamazoo. My first experience
      with an ACS local section was the
      KACS <a href="/event/2018/11/13/sutainable-science.html">Sustainable
      Science - Recycle a Poster</a> event at Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute;
      and I have since volunteered several times at the Chemistry Day
      at the Museum event and participated in many other KACS
      events. I would love to hear from KACS members about their
      experiences with KACS and the types of events and activities
      they would enjoy attending.

<h1 id="advocacy-tips">
  Tips on how to advocate for our science with elected public
  officials:
</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    Contact the legislator's scheduler to <strong>arrange an
      appointment</strong>. Introduce yourself as a constituent, and
      explain the purpose of the meeting. It's easier to meet elected
      officials in their local district offices.</li>
  <li>
    Set a meeting date. <strong>Aim to meet for 15-30
    minutes</strong>. If your legislator isn't available, try an
    appropriate staff person.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prepare</strong>. Research the legislator's opinions and
    his or her current and past positions on your issue. Bring simple,
    direct information that can be left behind.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anticipate questions</strong> and be ready with
    answers.</li>
  <li>
    If meeting in a group, assign someone to lead, and define
    everyone's role beforehand.</li>
  <li>
    Confirm your appointment the day before and arrive early.</li>
  <li>
    Explain your issue. <strong>Emphasize the issue's impact on the
      district</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    If the legislator has a history of supporting your issue,
    acknowledge that and thank him/her, but be ready to quickly move
    to the new aspect you wish to discuss. <strong>Be clear about what
    you are asking</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    If the legislator disagrees with you, be prepared to debate, but
    <strong>do not become overly argumentative or
    political</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    Emphasize the positives of your viewpoint. <strong>End the meeting
      on a positive note</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    Thank the legislator. Determine next steps.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Send a follow-up thank you letter.</strong> Include any
    additional information you offered to provide.</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="leadership-institute">Report: ACS Leadership Institute</h1>
<p class="caption">By Hershel Jude</p>

<p>
  As the 2019 Chair Elect of the Kalamazoo Local Section of the
  American Chemical Society, I attended the ACS Leadership Institute
  (LI) from January 25 to 27, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. In order to
  train ACS members and elected officials to become better and more
  effective leaders, the American Chemical Society hosts the LI in
  January of each year. Participants gain an understanding of the
  essential elements of effective leadership and an opportunity to
  interact with other local section leaders, technical division
  officers and ACS governance. Leadership development courses help
  participants develop core skills important in ACS leadership roles
  as well as in the workplace. In 2019, over 400 chemists participated
  in the Leadership Institute.
</p>
<p>
  As we all know, traveling out of West Michigan in January can be
  tricky. The trip started with a 4 am text informing me that my
  Kalamazoo to Chicago flight was cancelled due to weather. After
  rescheduling my flight and an interesting snowy drive to Grand
  Rapids, I arrived at the Leadership institute only 4 hours after it
  started! The Institute offered 16 courses to participants, of which
  we could choose two to attend. I chose Fostering Innovation and
  Collaborating Across Boundaries. In addition, all participants
  attending as part of their local section leadership team attended
  specialized sessions and a <em>Planning Successful Activities</em>
  course. The courses were hands on with a lot of activities to help
  participants understand the concepts being taught and there were
  many opportunities to share event ideas with other attendees. As
  Lydia Hines reported last year in the April 2018 KACS newsletter, we
  were regularly reminded about writing reports of our activities as
  they occur through the year and placing them in FORMS in preparation
  for the Annual Report submission. Also stressed upon at LI is the
  need for members to recruit new members. In 2011 there were 164,000
  ACS members and in 2018 that number had dropped to 151,000. In 2019,
  as part of the member get a member campaign the ACS is offering a
  special commemorative periodic table of the elements blanket in
  recognition of 2019 being declared the International Year of the
  Periodic Table.
</p>
<p>
  The leadership institute was a very productive, busy and enjoyable
  two-day event filled with lots of opportunities to learn and
  network. While these sessions were geared specifically to the ACS,
  most if not all of the information gained is directly applicable to
  being a productive member of any organization and well worth
  attending. Being able to attend the LI is a valuable benefit of
  volunteering our time and serving our professional society. We are
  looking for dedicated members to run for the KACS chair-elect seat
  for 2019, and maybe I will be reading your report from the LI next
  year!
