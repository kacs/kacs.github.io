      Another summer has flown by, and hints of fall abound.  That can
      only mean one thing: Election season is upon us!  Be on the
      lookout for ballot information from the National ACS office for
      the national elections.  More locally, watch your email for your
      KACS voting instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The KACS is in need of volunteers. We are currently looking to
      identify a new communications chair, as our longtime
      communications guru, David Bolliet, steps back from producing
      our newsletter and sending and fielding member email.  We are
      also looking to identify our next Chair-elect.  If you have
      interest in either position, please reach out to
      the <a href="/about/officers.html"

    <p>
      I also wanted to point out one of our two new logos,
      designed for us by local graphic
      artist <a href="http://www.carolynfink.com/"
		title="Carolyn's graphic design">Carolyn Fink</a>.
      I am also very fond of Carolyn’s sculpture work. Thank you, Carolyn!

    National Chemistry Week 2015 will be celebrated during the week of
    October 18-24, and this year’s theme
    is <span class="rainbow">Chemistry Colors Our World!</span>
    exploring the chemistry of dyes, pigments, and light. The
    Kalamazoo Section's largest and most extensive annual outreach to
    the community is our <strong>Chemistry Day at the Kalamazoo Valley
    Museum on 17 October from 12 noon to 4 pm</strong>. During the
    Chemistry Day event, our members and friends present
    chemistry-related hands-on activities to hundreds of young people
    and their families who come to visit the museum and to learn about
    the joys and impacts of chemistry and its usefulness.
  </p>
<p>
  If you have an experiment or demonstration in mind, or you would like to volunteer to
  help with the many activities we already have ready to go, please join us in showing
  Kalamazoo why chemistry has been, and continues to be, so important to this
  community and to share some of your excitement about science!

<h1 id="education-chair">Introducing our new Education Chair</h1>

<p class="author">By Brian Eklov</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <p>
      I want to introduce our new Education Committee Chair, <strong>Mike
	Walsh</strong>. Mike has a varied and interesting background,
      earning his BS in Chemistry at Rose-Hulman Institute of
      Technology. After a stint as an Army Medical Officer, Mike earned
      his Masters Degree from Mississippi State in 1992. Since then,
      Mike has served as a substitute teacher and tutor in Saginaw
      County, and as a Wastewater Analyst and Analytical Chemist in a
      number of places across the state. Mike landed in Kalamazoo in
      2000 with KAR Labs, and has been the <strong>Director of Chemical
	Laboratories at K College</strong> since 2010. We are excited to have Mike
      on board, and you can read his report of our annual Awards
      Gathering below. Education in all forms is a pillar of our
      Section. Welcome, Mike!

<h1 id="awards-gathering">KACS Annual Awards Gathering</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Walsh</p>
<p>
  The Kalamazoo section of the American Chemical Society held its
  <b>forty-second</b> annual awards program on Monday, May 11, 2015 at
  Western Michigan University.  Awardees gathered along with family
  members, educators, and KACS members at 6 pm for a reception in the
  Chemistry Building Atrium with light hors d’oeuvres.
</p>
<p>
  The ceremony followed at 6:45pm when KACS Chair Brian Eklov formally
  assembled all in attendance in the large lecture hall. Award
  presentations began with ACS 50+ members. First up
  was <strong>50-year member Dr. Malcolm W. Moon</strong> who shared
  with the audience his career and love of organic chemistry.
</p>
<p>
  Not to be outdone, <strong>Dr. Thomas Houser</strong> received an
  award as a 60-year member. He explained how he was transformed from
  factory worker to physical chemist to educator while injecting a
  couple of "propellant experiments gone awry" anecdotes.
</p>
<p>
  Next up, Western Michigan University Chemistry Department honored
  <strong>Nicholas Kapolka as their outstanding college chemistry
  student</strong> while <strong>Thanh Thanh Phan</strong> was honored
  with the same distinction from the Kalamazoo College Department of
  Chemistry.

  of all nominees, <strong>Charlene Dailey</strong> of Comstock High
  School was this year’s Outstanding High School Chemistry Teacher.
</p>
<p>
  High school teachers are asked to nominate an outstanding senior
  chemistry student. This year thirteen students were

<h1>Be a Science Coach and Help a Local Teacher</h1>

<p>
 ACS is looking to send 250 chemists back to the classroom as <a href="http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/science-coaches.html" title="More info on Science Coaches">ACS
    Science Coaches</a>. Will you consider being one of them? You can choose
 the teacher/grade you want to work with, the school will get $500 to
 enhance science education, and you get the satisfaction of making a
 difference. Coaches help teachers by answering tough chemistry
 questions, advising students on careers in chemistry, assisting
 during science labs, or giving chemical safety tips. The
 requirements: Commit to six, 1-hour teacher visits over the course of
 a year; be a current or retired professional chemist, graduate
 student, or postdoctoral scholar; and have a passion for inspiring
 future generations of chemists. Enrollment for 2015-16 school year is
 now open. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis until October
 30, 2015.

<h1>2015 Project SEED &ndash; Another Success</h1>
<p class="author">By Lydia E.M. Hines</p>

<p>
  In 2015, the KACS, through our coordinator Dr. Donald Schreiber,
  identified two eligible students, both from Comstock High School,
  who expressed an interest in science as a career; they availed
  themselves of this summer research opportunity in the labs of
  <b>Drs. Ramakrishna Guda and Blair Szymczyna</b> at Western Michigan
  University
</p>

<p>
  The students, Kathryn Way, here for her second summer with Dr. Guda
  (i.e. a Summer II student) and Jacob Wasyliw, a Summer I student
  with Dr. Szymczyna presented posters describing their research in
  the Haenicke Hall Atrium on the WMU campus on Wednesday, August 5,
  between the hours of 10am and 12 noon. They, along with presenters
  preparing to become science educators, welcomed a small but
  interested group of visitors, which included some KACS members. The
  pictures shown below were shared with us by Robin Lenkart of WMU.
</p>

    <p class="caption">Jacob Wasyliw &ndash; SEED I student with Dr. Szymczyna</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  The following is what Dr. Guda has to say about Kathryn:
  <blockquote>
    <b>Kathryn Way</b> (2014, 2015 Project SEED student) has been
      working on a project to sense blood glucose with novel
      macromolecule/nanostructure composites. She has been working on
      DNA/gold nanoparticles, porphyrin aggregates/graphene oxide
      composites to build colorimetric and luminescence-based glucose
      sensors. A senior at Comstock High School, she recently was
      named a recipient of Excellence In Education recognition. She
      has been awarded a full scholarship at Yale University where she
      plans to begin her undergraduate study in chemical engineering
    in the Fall of 2015.
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  Jacob plans to attend Michigan State University to study Business.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Dr. Ramakrishna Guda</b>x (WMU), a KACS member who has served a
  mentor to SEED students for the last 4 years is happy to share
  another comment about a former Project SEED mentee: <b>Mikayla
  Markus</b> (2012, 2013 Project SEED student) worked on novel
  spectroscopic techniques to monitor protein unfolding and
  aggregation; she demonstrated that two-photon spectroscopy can be a
  potential imaging technique for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
  disease. With the support of ACS Project SEED, she was motivated to
  pursue an undergraduate degree and is currently a sophomore at
  Western Michigan University pursuing her degree in Nursing.

<h1>WMU CGSA 2015 Picnic</h1>
<p class="author">By Sarut Jianrattanasawat</p>

<p>
  On May 22, the Chemistry Graduate Student Association (CGSA) of
  Western Michigan University hosted its 5 th annual spring picnic for
  local chemists at Oshtemo Township Park.  First and foremost, CGSA
  would like to thank KACS and Western’s Graduate Student Advisory
  Committee for the generous financial support. The event was
  successful. We had more than 60 attendees, including faculty, staff,
  undergraduate and graduate students from WMU, and KACS members from
  around Kalamazoo. Many participated in activities such as volleyball
  and soccer. We are glad to see this event remaining a popular local
  tradition.
