      Lucas Chadwick received a B.A. in chemistry from Kalamazoo
      College in Kalamazoo, MI. He went on to earn his Ph.D. from the
      University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), where his work at the
      UIC/NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research
      focused on the pharmacognosy of hops (<em>Humulus lupulus</em> L.).
      After a post-doctoral appointment in the Botanical Center, he
      began employment at Kalsec, Inc., where he worked on natural
      antioxidants and process development. In 2006, Luke co-founded
      Wrightwood Technologies and was subsequently awarded a Small
      Business Innovative Research Grant to automate a preparative
      chromatographic technique known as countercurrent
      chromatography. After a one-year stint working to develop
      methodologies for metabolomic analysis of human plasma at the
      University of Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, Luke
      joined Bell's Brewery, Inc. in 2010 as quality/lab manager and
      has served as senior scientist at Bell's since 2015.

      KACS is again sponsoring the annual WMU Chemistry Graduate
      Student Association (CGSA) spring picnic. The purpose of this
      event is to introduce chemistry graduate and undergraduate
      students to the KACS community outside of the university. In
      previous years, this event has been a successful opportunity to
      gather professors, students, and local ACS members. This is a
      family-friendly event with many activities and yummy food!

  In the last issue of the Newsletter I presented information
  regarding the distinction between ACS Districts and Rgions; in this
  issue I want to turn our attention to the rich resource called the
  <a href="https://acs.org" title="ACS website">acs.org</a> website.
  There you will find a vast amount of services which our Society
  makes available to us as members, as well as some education
  materials which our Society generously makes accessible to
  non-members as well.  Many have mentioned that it is “difficult to
  navigate” the website, but on a recent check it seems to have been
  revised to be more “user-friendly”.
</p>

<p>
  In this issue of the newsletter I want to highlight
  the <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers.html"><strong>Careers
  section</strong></a>, which is replete with <strong>opportunities
  for members</strong>, from students to more seasoned chemists; there
  one can find advice concerning the interview process, a presentation
  of career alternatives, ways to assess one’s strengths and
  weaknesses, instruction on how to connect with personal mentors, and
  much more.  Also, in each first monthly issue of C&amp;E News there
  is an article on some aspect of employment – from how to seek it, to
  how to reflect on your changing aspirations, to how to respond to
  challenging situations in the workplace, etc.  For a list of the
  many services offered go
  to <a href="https://acs.org/careers">acs.org/careers</a>.  If your
  interest is in having someone mentor you, find out
  more <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-services/ccp.html"
  title="career consulting page">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Another option available is to select one of the many ACS
  e-publications on careers in chemistry – traditional or
  non-traditional – these may be found at
  <a href="http://connect.acspubs.org/acsebooksnow">connect.acspubs.org/acsebooksnow</a>.

      On Nov. 7, 2017 KACS hosted its annual poster session titled
      "Sustainable Science - Recycle a Poster" at Bell's Eccentric
      Café in downtown Kalamazoo. For the 7th year in a row, KACS
      organized this public event, which was made possible through a
      generous grant from Zoetis. There was a record turnout of 153
      people. This keynote speaker was Monique Wilhelm from the
      University of Michigan-Flint. In her roles as Laboratory Manager
      and Adjunct Lecturer, she witnessed the water crisis first hand
      when it first unfolded in 2014. Her presentation “The Real
      Crisis with Flint’s Water - It Was Preventable and Can Happen to
      You!” included a demo with hands-on activities for the
      audience. It involved three pennies, a salt pack, vinegar and
      plastic containers to learn about the influence of the water’s
      pH on metal. In addition to the keynote speech, there was a
      poster session with over 30 presentations, including 21 student
      presenters.  At least 50% of those in attendance were ACS
      members. Participants enjoyed hot appetizers and beer from 5 to
      9 PM while listening to the keynote speech, mingling and
      reviewing the displays. Posters highlighted work from Zoetis,
      Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University (WMU), among
      others. Some work was done in collaboration with other
      institutions.

  Students who submitted a poster abstract for this event ahead of
  time had the opportunity to win a $50 cash prize, which was handed
  out by KACS Treasurer Bill Schinzer. The lucky winners were Daniel
  Corey, Jashaun Bottoms and Gabriel Aleida
  Alves. The <span class="winner">prizewinners</span> presented the
  following posters.

  This year’s event also included the celebration of the “Partners
  for Progress and Prosperity (P3) Award” that was given to the
  Kalamazoo ACS Local Section, Zoetis, and Bell’s Eccentric
  Caf&eacute; for offering this annual poster event in a 3-way
  collaboration. The award was given for incorporating 3 important
  categories, specifically for 1) organizing a public event to help
  improve the public image and perception of science in general and
  of chemistry in particular; 2) helping improve career development
  through networking opportunities in an informal setting; and 3)
  supporting the importance of STEM education and research via its
  keynote speaker and poster session.
</p>
<p>
  KACS Chair Dr. Steve Secreast also showed a brief video he filmed
  at the Kalamazoo pedestrian mall that showed public volunteers
  reciting the elements of the periodic table. Last but not least,
  the KACS Board is grateful for the financial support that Zoetis
  has provided to help defer the expenses associated with this
  event.

      KACS rented "The Back Room" at Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute; for
      this event. It was a full house where 153 people showed up,
      scientists and non-scientists, situated downstairs and upstairs
      to hear a presentation about the Flint water crisis by Monique
      Wilhelm from UM Flint.

      For the fall of 2018, KACS is considering hosting an evening of
      chemists painting!
    </p>

    <p>
      The proposed three hour event would be help at the local
      family-owned business, <a href="https://happyourart.com/">Happy Our
	Art</a>, where one of their trained artists would guide our group in
      painting the same chemistry-themed image on a 16" &times; 20"
      canvas.  No art training is required! Only the desire to have fun
      and learn something new! This establishment can hold up to 50 people
      with a minimum of 15 attendees. ACS would provide light
      refreshments, but the venue is BYOB so participants are also able
      bring their preferred food and beverage.  Typical cost of $35 per
      person, but the cost may vary depending upon the number of
      individuals who attend.
