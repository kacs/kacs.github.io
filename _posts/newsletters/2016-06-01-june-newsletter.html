   May was another very busy month for the KACS. A group of members
   went to Miller Auditorium to see Alton Brown's <em>Eat Your Science
   Tour</em> on May 5th. Our annual awards gathering was on May 9th,
   where we honored 50-and 60-year ACS members, awarded students and a
   teacher of the year, and gave awards to our competitive exam
   winners. Then, on the 14th, we held a Science Caf&eacute; Field
   Trip to the Journeyman Distillery in Three Oaks, where we learned a
   little about the art of distilling from their production staff, and
   marveled at their analytical chemistry tools! Reports on all of
   these happenings, as well as reports from the national meeting, and
   more are below, so read on!

<h1 id="journeyman">Science Caf&eacute; Field Trip to Journeyman Distillery</h1>
<p class="author">By Brian Eklov</p>

<p>
 Our Science Caf&eacute; Field Trip to Journeyman Distilling in Three
 Oaks, MI took place on May 14, and was attended by fourteen members
 and guests of the KACS and nine members of the St. Joseph Valley
 Local Section. We started with a discussion of the history of the
 facility, which started out as a featherbone corset and buggy whip
 factory, and then stood empty for decades before a major restoration
 effort turned it into a distillery. We then toured their production
 space, which currently includes a 1000 gallon still which they run
 for two twelve hour runs each day to collect about 25 gallons of
 spirit a day! We had a great discussion about the heads, hearts,
 and tails of the distillation run, and many of us were both amazed
 and disappointed to find out that all of their analytical chemistry
 in analyzing their cuts is done by taste! We ended our visit by
 tasting many of their fourteen bottled spirits, learning a little
 about proper tasting along the way.

<h1 id="san-diego">ACS San Diego Meeting Report</h1>
<p class="author">By Gabe Kornis</p>

<p>
  Dr. Gabe Kornis, a 50-year member of ACS, attended the recent San
  Diego ACS Meeting. Below is a summary of a few presentations he
  found of interest. While in California, Dr. Kornis, a Pfizer/Upjohn
  retiree, attended predominantly the Organic and Medicinal Chemistry
  sessions at the meeting.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  C-H activation and selective derivatizations were topics of many
  discussions and presentations. A few examples were:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Highly enantioselective copper catalyzed methods for the
      hydroamination of olefins whether exocyclic, endocyclic,
      terminal, or adjacent.</li>
    <li>
      In olefin metathesis the discovery of new ligand complexes based
      on molybdenum, tungsten and ruthenium resulted in selectivity
      for Z-olefins, both in cross and in ring closing
      metathesis.</li>
    <li>
      Triple bond metathesis addition reactions to internal alkynes
      via Au or Pt catalysis.</li>
    <li>A simple new reaction consisting of an activated ester,
    dialkylzinc, and a pyridine ligand to attach two carbons that each
    has three other single bonds.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
 In a memorable lecture, Scott Miller (Yale) discussed catalytic
 site-selective alterations of complex glycopeptide antibiotics.
 Vancomycin, the antibiotic of last resort has been associated with
 multiple drug resistant bacteria. It has nine hydroxyl groups each
 of which individually were catalytically removed or replaced by
 other groups. Promising antibacterial analogues were thus made in
 one or two steps. After many years of traditional research,
 antimicrobial resistance is causing large numbers of deaths,
 especially from hospital infections. Drug development in
 antibacterial compounds suffers a much lower success rate than in
 most other areas partially due to the lack of novel mechanisms of
 action. The dose of antibacterials is very high per day due to the
 lack of rapid diagnostic procedures, the ability of bacterial
 biomass to grow rapidly hitting several targets, the bacterial
 membrane which acts as a barrier to the entrance of antibacterials,
 and the cells ability to flush out whatever drug has gained
 entrance. To combat the problem two approaches were presented:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems are targets for beta
   lactamase leading to loss of activity. A number of compounds
   are in clinical trial with the aim of replacing clavulanic acid,
   a known beta lactamase inhibitor.</li>
    <li>The total synthesis of tetracycline analogues via tandem
    annulation of precursor ring AB with precursor ring D leading to a
    large number of compounds some of which show activity against Gram
    negative bacteria. This is in contrast to semi-synthetic efforts,
    which provide very few biologically active molecules.</li>
  </ul>

<h1 id="awards-banquet">43rd Annual Awards Program</h1>
<p class="author">By Michael T. Walsh</p>

<p>
  The Kalamazoo section of the American Chemical Society held its
  forty-third annual awards program on Monday, May 9, 2016 in the
  chemistry building atrium on the campus of Western Michigan
  University. Awardees gathered along with family members, educators,
  and KACS members at 6pm for a reception with light hors
  d’oeuvres. The ceremony began at 6:45pm when KACS Chair Brian Eklov
  formally assembled all in attendance. Award presentations began with
  ACS 50+ members <strong>Al Blum</strong>, <strong>Herman
  W. Smith</strong>, and <strong>Roger G. Williams</strong> (pictures
  below). All three spoke briefly of their careers and love of
  chemistry. Additional 50-year members recognized but unable to
  attend were <strong>William E. Heyd</strong>, <strong>Gabe
  I. Kornis</strong>, <strong>Thomas L. Miller</strong>, and
  <strong>Ekkehard Sinn</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Next up were the 60-year members! This year we recognized two
  chemists who have achieved this milestone. Both <strong>David G. Martin</strong> and
  <strong>Howard A. Whaley</strong> were present and briefly spoke of
  their professional experiences in the chemistry field (photographs
  below).
</p>

<h2>Outstanding High School Chemistry Teacher Award</h2>

<p>
  Western Michigan University Chemistry Department
  honored <strong>Casey Wright</strong> as their outstanding college
  chemistry student while <strong>Mara Birndorf</strong> was honored
  with the same distinction from the Kalamazoo College Department of
  Chemistry (picture below). This year’s Outstanding High School
  Chemistry Teacher Award went to Chris Orlaske of Lawrence
  Junior-Senior High School.

<h2>Outstanding High School Chemistry Student Awards</h2>


<p>
  High school teachers are asked to nominate an outstanding senior
  chemistry student. This year ten students were recognized. Each
  <strong>Outstanding High School Chemistry Student</strong> received
  an Amazon gift card. A list of recipients and the student's high
  school appears below.

<h1 id="alton-brown">Report &ndash; Alton Brown Live: <i>Eat Your Science</i></h1>
<p class="author">By Brian Eklov</p>

<p>
  Our Miller Auditorium outing was to see Alton Brown on May
  5<sup>th</sup>.  Twenty members and their guests came out to see
  Alton Brown talk, sing, and rant. Many of you may know him from his
  show Good Eats on the Food Network, where he described not only the
  hows of cooking, but the science whys as well. All said, the
  three-hour show was entertaining, the music was good, the commentary
  was sharp, and it isn't every day that you get to watch someone pop
  popcorn on a searchlight.

<h1 id="cgsa">Report &ndash; CGSA and DowBQ Picnics</h1>
<p class="author">By Michael T. Walsh and Christine Pruis</p>

<p>
  n May KACS continued its traditions of sponsoring end-of-school-year
  picnics for two local chemistry student groups. On Friday May
  20<sup>th</sup>, the annual WMU Chemistry Graduate Student
  Association (CGSA) spring picnic occurred at the Oshtemo Township
  park on West Main. It was well attended by graduate and
  undergraduate students, WMU faculty, KACS members, as well as many
  family members. The weather was perfect for grilling, socializing,
  and just playing in the park!  The Kalamazoo College ACS chapter
  hosted the annual DowBQ on May 24, 2016, for all of the science
  community at Kalamazoo College. This end of the year event allows
  students and faculty from the Biology and Chemistry departments to
  eat delicious food, mingle, and get to know each other in a casual
  atmosphere. First years and sophomores had the chance to ask
  upperclassmen about their Senior Individual Projects (SIPs),
  classes, and plans for after graduation. Over 180 students and
  professors attended the event and took time to celebrate the end of
  the year together.
