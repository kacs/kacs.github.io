    <p>
      The cookies, pies and other holiday sweets derive their flavor
      from spices including vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon.  Another
      group of chemicals responsible for flavor, especially citrus
      flavors, are the terpenes. This is a large group of molecules
      based upon isoprene which deserves a discussion of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common spices, vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon, derive their
      flavor and odor from aromatic compounds.  Interestingly, the
      term &ldquo;aromatic&rdquo; came about because the first known
      aromatic compounds were fragrant substances. These fragrant
      molecules were found in balsams, and essential oils. In view of
      the origin of the term &ldquo;aromatic,&rdquo; perhaps it is not
      surprising that the flavor of these common spices comes from
      aromatic compounds. All the spice flavoring compounds noted
      below, contain oxygen in the form of phenols, alcohols,
      aldehydes, ketones and ethers. Here are some of the compound
      which give the common spices their flavor.  As I have noted
      before, chemistry is everywhere &ndash; even in a pumpkin pie.

<h1 id="science-cafe">October Science Caf&eacute; Report</h1>
<p class="author">By Brian Eklov</p>
<p>
  James Engelmann, Exhibition Designer at the Cleveland Museum of Art,
  was the speaker at this fall's Science Caf&eacute;. Mr. Engelmann
  discussed how art has changed throughout history based upon the
  chemical technologies available at the time an artist was
  working. This then led to a discussion of how modern restoration
  work at the Cleveland Museum employs spectroscopy to determine where
  works have been altered based upon the different colorant
  chemistries employed when the work was created, and then later
  restored or edited. This information can then be used to accurately
  restore a work to an earlier state, and to repair earlier
  restoration attempts. The talk was very well received and was well
  attended.

<h1 id="wally-hines">Wally Hines <i>in Memoriam</i></h1>
<p class="author">By Doug Williams</p>
<p>
  We are saddened by the death of 67-year ACS member Wallis Gartside
  Hines on October 31, 2014. Wally was born in Chicago, Ill. on
  Feb. 2, 1919, the fifth son of Herbert Waldo and Helen (Gartside)
  Hines. He graduated from Springfield High School (IL) in 1935. As a
  young man Wally had his heart set on becoming a surgeon; he became
  turned on to Chemistry after being in Dr. John C. Bailar's freshman
  chemistry class at the U of Illinois where he began his collegiate
  studies and completed a B.S. degree in applied science from Michigan
  State College in 1941. Following WWII, he earned an M.S. in organic
  chemistry from Michigan State University (MSU) in 1948, and his
  Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Louisiana State University in
  1968. Wally had a long and adventurous career in chemistry that
  included laboratory jobs with Ditzler Color Co. of Detroit,
  E. I. duPont at the Kankakee Ordnance Works of Joliet, IL, the
  Michigan State Department of Agriculture Labs of Lansing, the
  Burlington Railroad, Armour Pharmaceutical Co., and The Upjohn
  Co. He also had an academic career as professor and head of the
  chemistry department at Aurora College (now University) in Illinois
  for 16 years and 20 years as director of chemistry labs at Kalamazoo
  College, from which he retired at age 84. He also had brief teaching
  assignments at Southwestern Michigan College in Dowagiac, Kalamazoo
  Valley Community College, and Nazareth College. We fondly remember
  Wally's faithful service to the KACS in many capacities, including
  his term as our local section Chair in 1986. Wally was awarded our
  section service award in 1991. He is survived by his wife, Lydia
  (Moissidou) Hines of Kalamazoo, two sons, three daughters, one
  brother, three sisters-in-law; three grandchildren; six
  great-grandchildren; three great-great- grandsons; many, many
  nieces, nephews and cousins. He was predeceased by one son, one
  grandson, six brothers, and two sisters. Wally served in WWII with
  the Third Chemical Mortar Battalion in Italy, France, Belgium and
  Germany. He served eight years as a member of Gideons International,
  and was a member of Berean Baptist Church in Portage. Whatever Wally
  did he pursued with a passion – and he had a passion for his
  genealogical research, which he began in 1970. He demanded
  perfection of himself and others and did everything to the best of
  his ability. His life verse was Galatians 6:2 &ldquo;Bear ye one
  another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ&rdquo;. His body
  has been willed to the MSU Medical School; it will later be cremated
  and ashes scattered over Isaacs Harbour, Nova Scotia (ancestral
  homesite).

<h2>Gobles Elementary School Science Day</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>23 October 2014</p>
    <p>
      On Mole day our KACS secretary, Angela Willson, spent the afternoon
      at Gobles Elementary School in response to their preschool teacher's
      request for assistance with a grant she had received to promote STEM
      at her school. It was their first ever school-wide celebration of
      science.  Over 50 students and parents went from room to room open
      house style and got to see many experiments to get them interested
      in science. Our celebration of chemistry included activities dealing
      with soap, like surface tension of water and milk and foaming
      hydrogen peroxide (elephant toothpaste). The elementary students
      definitely enjoyed their afternoon of learning about chemistry
      through hands on activities.

<h2>Haverhill Elementary School’s Halloween Science Celebration</h2>
<p>
  We celebrated another fun day of science with some of our local
  elementary schoolers by demonstrating science experiments at the
  all-school assembly on 30 October. Demonstrations included the
  colors of gobstoppers, dry ice bubbles, elephant toothpaste in a
  pumpkin, and other festive Halloween science-themed activities. Deb
  VanAntwerp, a third grade teacher, gave the following glowing review
  about the presentation: &ldquo;Your experiments were festive,
  meaningful, interesting, and fun, and you explained everything in
  such a positive, understandable manner! You really made Chemistry
  come alive for all of us!&rdquo;

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2>Kalamazoo College Chemistry Club Activities</h2>
<p class="author">By Mara Birndorff and Sarah Glass</p>
<p>
  In an effort to promote chemistry and membership in Kalamazoo
  College's ACS student group, a Mole Day event was held in the lounge
  of the Dow Science Center on 23 October 2014. There were donuts,
  hot chocolate and mole jokes around the room for students along
  with faculty to come and enjoy throughout the day. Many students use
  this as a way to relax after getting out of lab. This is an
  important opportunity for chemistry and biology majors to socialize
  with each other and for first-years and sophomores to ask
  upperclassman about their Senior Individualized Projects (SIPs),
  classes, and plans for after graduation. Overall, Mole day brings
  the science majors of Dow together to celebrate an integral part of
  National Chemistry Week while piquing students' interest in
  chemistry in a fun environment. This was a successful event which
  was made possible with the financial support from KACS.

<h1 id="scimix">Sci-Mix Poster Session at Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute;</h1>
<p class="author">By Elke Schoffers with photos by Brian Eklov</p>
<p>
  Now in its fourth year, KACS hosted the annual poster session titled
  <em>Sustainable Science &ndash; Recycle a Poster</em> at Bell's
  brewery downtown Kalamazoo on 5 Nov 2014. An unprecedented crowd of
  over 120 participants visited the local pub.
</p>
<p>
  For the first time KACS hosted an out-of-state speaker for this
  event series. The audience was excited to hear an engaging
  presentation by Prof. Tim Jamison from Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology. Jamison is known for his novel methods in organic
  synthesis and their implementation in the total synthesis of natural
  products. In his seminar on <em>Continuous Flow Multistep
  Synthesis</em> he outlined how flow chemistry holds so much
  potential to reduce reaction times and increase efficiency.
</p>
<p>
  Visitors had a chance to enjoy hot appetizers and beer while
  listening to the presentation, which was followed by the poster
  session. There were dozens of presenters, including 27
  students. Some posters were newly prepared or "recycled" from a
  previous conference. Poster contributions were based on research
  carried out at Carnegie Mellon University, Kalamazoo College, KAMSC,
  Michigan State University, Oklahoma State University, Rutgers
  University-Newark, Western Michigan University and
  Zoetis. Attendants were able to mingle, enjoy a relaxed atmosphere
  and continue informal discussions with Jamison and other scientists
  from academia and industry.
</p>
<p>
  This last event of the year was also an opportunity to thank all
  volunteers without whom KACS could not fulfill its goals and
  missions. For example, Dr. Lydia Hines received the ACS <em>2014
  Outreach Volunteer of the Year</em> award. The event was made
  possible through a generous grant by Zoetis.
