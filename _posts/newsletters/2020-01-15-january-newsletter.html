<h1 id="one-well-event">One Well Brewing helps KACS Celebrate IYPT</h1>

<p>
  About 30 members, family and friends joined us at One Well Brewing
  (4213 Portage St, Kalamazoo) on Monday, Oct 21 to celebrate IYPT and
  donate a portion of patron sales to our Project SEED
  fund. Participants took periodic table trivia quizzes and received
  commemorative pint glasses and wallet size periodic tables. A hearty
  thank you the team at One Well for hosting us and making our event
  successful. Check our <a href="https://kalamazooiypt.wordpress.com/"

<h1 id="project-seed">Do you have what it takes to be a Project SEED mentor?</h1>
<p>
  Are you a scientist who would like to inspire a high school student
  to pursue studies and a career in chemistry or a related discipline?
  Do you work in a facility that conducts scientific study and could
  offer such a student an 8 week research experience in Summer 2020?
  If you answered yes to these questions, then Project SEED can
  connect you with a promising high school student who has one or more
  years of chemistry and comes from a family with financial
  need. Stipends for the students are paid by funds from ACS and from
  our local section. This year, our local section is committed to
  funding for at least two students. Additional students will be
  accepted if adequate funding and projects are identified. If you are
  interested, please send a note to
  <a href="/people/williams.htmldwilliams@kalsec.com">Doug
  Williams</a> for more information.

<h1 id="speed-networking">Speed Networking</h1>
<p>
  In late September of this year (2019), we continued the
  collaborative effort between the KACS, and the Department of
  Chemistry and the Center for Career and Professional Development at
  Kalamazoo College, by offering our <em>third annual</em> networking
  program to our <strong>area college students interested in the field
  of chemistry</strong>. This <em>Speed-networking event</em> has
  received the ACS <em>P3 Award</em> on two occasions from the Great
  Lakes Region and has become one of the highlights of our section's
  programming each year since its inception in 2017. The <strong>32
  students</strong> who chose to participate came from the chemistry
  departments of Kalamazoo College, Western Michigan University and
  Kalamazoo Valley Community College; they had the opportunity to
  engage in planned activities to increase their understanding of work
  in the field as well as to make connections with industry
  professionals who were willing to spend an evening sharing advice
  and expertise with them. Area industries like Pfizer, Zoetis,
  Forensic Fluids and Kalsec once again supplied a majority of the 21
  mentors. We extend our thanks to Kalamazoo College for their
  enthusiasm in hosting this well-received opportunity to the
  Kalamazoo-area college community.

  On November 12 th the Kalamazoo Section of the American Chemical
  Society (KACS) had another successful Recycle-A-Poster event
  sponsored by Zoetis at the Back room of Bell's Eccentric Caf&eacute;
  in downtown Kalamazoo. Despite the unusually snowy weather on that
  day this highly-anticipated award-winning event, which occurs every
  fall and provides an opportunity for local chemists to talk science
  in a relaxed atmosphere over drinks and hors d'oeuvres, attracted
  about 70 participants. The evening started with a surprise
  presentation of a Tribute to the KACS by Senator Sean McCann in
  recognition of the International Year of the Periodic Table. That
  was followed by our keynote speaker, Dr. Benjamin Swarts of Central
  Michigan University, who gave an incredible talk on his career and
  his use of chemical biology to explore novel approaches to diagnose
  and treat tuberculosis. The program concluded with the opportunity
  to review the 26 "recycled" posters displayed by undergraduate
  students, graduate students as well as local industrial chemists; of
  those posters submitted by a publicized deadline three were
  randomly-selected as winners and each presenter received a $50 Visa
  gift card: Audrey Searing (WMU, NSF REU research at MSU),
  Christopher Vennard (Kalamazoo College, Chemistry), and Halle
  Nienhaus (WMU, Biological Sciences).  KACS is greatly indebted to
  Zoetis, our long-term sponsor for this annual event, and would also
  like to offer our sincere thanks to our speaker, Dr. Swarts, and the
  event coordinators, Drs. Tomasz Respondek (Zoetis) and Kelly Teske
  (WMU), for their diligent efforts in providing us with an amazing
  night!
