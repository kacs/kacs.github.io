      Things are really starting to warm up now that spring is finally
      here.  In this installment of our newsletter we are highlighting
      a few upcoming events.  First, we will have one outreach event
      for Chemists Celebrate Earth Day at the Oshtemo branch of the
      Kalamazoo Public Library on 25 April from 1-3 pm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our annual awards gathering will be on May 11th at 6 pm.  Please
      join us to honor our competitive exam winners, outstanding high
      school and college chemistry students, our high school teacher
      of the year, and 50- and 60-year ACS members (RSVP details
      below).
    </p>
    <p>
      To top off the spring schedule, we have the Joint Great Lakes /
      Central Regional Meeting May 27-30 in Grand Rapids. Please plan
      on joining us for this special event - more details are below,
      but I'd like to draw attention to the request from the national
      ACS office.  ACS is asking for feedback from industrial chemists
      during our regional meeting. I'd like them to hear from members
      in our region, and especially from our section.  See below for
      more details about how to make your voice heard, and help shape
      the direction of our Society and the services it provides.

<h2>Education Committee News</h2>
<p>
  Fifteen High Schools in our Allegan-Kalamazoo-Van Buren county Local
  Section area accepted our invitation to give their students the
  annual Competitive Chemistry examination, the first exam of two
  which we use to determine winners for our Section scholarship
  awardees each year. That exam was given on March 17; the students
  who had the top 10 scores overall, along with those who received the
  three top scores in their school's cohort, were invited to a take a
  second examination on the WMU campus on April 25.
</p>
<p>
  The awardees are identified based on the results from the second
  examination; they, along with their parents are invited to an Awards
  Gathering, which is to be held once again at 6 pm in the atrium of
  the Chemistry Building on the WMU campus on Monday, May 11, 2015.
</p>
<p>
  Section members are invited to join the award winners and their
  families at that event &ndash; we want to encourage these young people as
  they proceed in their studies. At that time we also recognize
  outstanding high school chemistry students as identified by their
  respective chemistry teachers, an outstanding HS teacher,
  outstanding college chemistry students from our 2 local 4-year
  post-secondary chemistry departments, as well as 50-year members.
</p>
<p>
  These events would not be possible without the able and diligent
  assistance of Mrs. Robin Lenkart, and Drs. James Kiddle, Sherine
  Obare and Andre Venter, all of WMU's Chemistry Department. To
  ascertain that we have enough refreshments available, we request
  that you let us know by May 4 whether or not you will be present at
  this gathering. Mrs. Lenkart can be reached at 387-2922
  or <a href="mailto:robin.k.lenkart@wmich.edu"

<h2>CCED (Chemists Celebrate Earth Day) 2015</h2>
<p>
  The theme for Chemists Celebrate Earth Day (CCED) this year is
  &ldquo;Climate Science: More Than Just a Weather Report&rdquo;.  We
  have scheduled two outreach events in April, the first was at the
  Kalamazoo Nature Center on April 18 (10 am &ndash; 4 pm) during
  their Earth Day celebration (with free admission) where
  age-appropriate information and hands-on activities were offered to
  the patrons. Maren Zanotti
  (<a href="mailto:maren.c.zanotti@wmich.edu"
      title="E-mail Maren">maren.c.zanotti@wmich.edu</a>)
  continues as our KACS
  coordinator this year.
</p>
<p>
  Our second outreach will be at the Oshtemo branch of the Kalamazoo
  Pubic Library on West Main Street during their outdoor Earth Day
  event on 25 April from 1-3 pm. Brian Eklov and Lydia Hines have
  offered to interact with the young people and their parents at that
  location, but your offers of help will not be turned away!  You may
  contact <a href="/people/hines.html"
	     title="Contact info for Lydia">Lydia Hines</a>
  if you would like to join the fun. Due to the
  limited interest in past years in the illustrated poem contest,
  we will not be pursuing that opportunity this year.
