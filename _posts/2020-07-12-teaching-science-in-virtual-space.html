  Teachers everywhere have been forced to teach remotely and in new
  ways. Challenges seem especially difficult for disciplines such as
  the physical and life sciences that rely on laboratory
  training. These challenges have caused chemists
  to

     title="C&EN article">question the effectiveness</a> of
     traditional laboratory approaches in general.
</p>
<p>
  The following stories highlight the efforts of two faculty members,
  Christine Pruis and Cynthia Schauer, at KVCC to address these
  challenges. Chris explains her motivation:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I was so impressed with how my students rose to the challenge of
    the switch to online midterm and the work that they did then. My
    current summer students are also quite impressive. One student
    shared with me that her mother passed away from COVID and many are
    working full time and/or have families. They really inspire me.
  </p>

  Local High School teachers have expressed interest to us in learning
  how our Kalamazoo ACS members might help them in their classes
  through presentations on careers and research work or assistance
  with curriculum/activity development. We are considering a variety
  of approaches to build our local teacher outreach program through
  mentoring and small grants. <strong>Are you someone who might be
  able to help a local teacher?</strong> If so, please

  When classes at KVCC abruptly switched to fully online March of 2020
  due to Covid-19, I launched myself fully into creating a supportive
  and adaptive learning environment amidst my own struggles related to
  the situation. The first thing I did was send a reassuring video
  message to all my students. The next thing was to begin the
  seemingly herculean effort of rapidly converting the ground lecture
  and lab to an online course. Due to multiple pots of coffee a day
  and many sleepless nights, I hit the ground running with recorded
  lectures, online quizzes, and lab simulations. But, just like my
  coffee fix, my class and I quickly hit a wall. Ultimately this wall
  was the best thing that could have happened to us, as the process of
  finding a way around it created the most unique and fulfilling
  course of my twelve years of higher-ed teaching.
</p>
<p>
  Having taught blended courses in the past at Arizona State
  University and having worked as a Subject Matter Expert for an
  educational digital media publisher, I have extensive experience
  recording chemistry lectures and creating digital content. However,
  I quickly found that <strong>simply reverting to my old skills and
  past expectations was not very effective with my students during the
  Covid-induced switch to online learning</strong>. At first I could
  not figure out why these students, who I knew were smart and
  competent, were struggling with the online course! But after a few
  open and honest emails from students the reasons became clear. They
  already knew each other from a face-to-face course and they were
  used to interactive ground lectures, discussions, and laboratory
  collaborations. Furthermore, because they had not signed up for an
  online course many did not have the resources or, dare I say skills,
  to succeed in that environment. And of course, all of the changes in
  this class were being mirrored in their other courses and all other
  aspects of their lives!
</p>
<p>
  This revelation resulted in some reflection and research. What was
  my purpose as an educator? What expectations from the face-to-face
  course were non-negotiable? What types of assessments best helped
  students reach the learning outcomes? What methods created an
  equitable learning environment? Countless educators and I are still
  grappling with these types of questions. However, relatively quickly
  I was able to make many adjustments to assignment types,
  communication style, and general expectations while retaining high
  quality standards for students and myself. Below are some
  implemented changes which increased student engagement, equity, and
  education.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In lieu of synchronous video conferencing class and lab sessions,
    I elected to <strong>present material in an asynchronous manner
    via pre-recorded lectures and online lab
    simulations/activities</strong>. While students had signed up for
    a face-to-face class at a specific time, the sudden switch to
    online learning often came with drastic changes to schedules and
    commitments. The asynchronous presentation style allowed students
    to complete material at a time and location convenient for their
    lives.
  </li>
  <li>
    I recorded lectures and tutorials on my tablet and posted them on
    Canvas, KVCC's Learning management System. Each video focused on
    one or two main concepts with a self-imposed time limit of 20
    min. The analytics showed that the shorter time span increased
    video views and completion rates. The displayed clarity of the
    concepts covered allowed students to focus on the videos which
    they needed. The data also showed many students would often watch
    select videos multiple times.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the face-to-face lecture and lab, I encourage learning by
    doing. I wanted to continue this in the online environment. This
    prompted me to focus on developing purposeful and effective
    assessments. I could no longer use many of the materials developed
    for an in person experience. <strong>Tests were revamped, quizzes
    adjusted, experiments reimagined, group activities modified, and
    lab reports revised all with the goal of retaining specific
    learning outcomes.</strong> For example, instead of hand written
    "show your work" tests I elected to split the tests into two
    parts: a confirmative assessment involving algorithmically
    randomized quiz questions along with a unique summative assessment
    handwritten portion. My favorite summative assessment was giving
    students "data" from space rock minerals and having them create
    the periodic table and construct Lewis structures from the alien
    planet (newsflash: this planet had an "sextet rule" instead of an
    "octet rule").
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>An additional assessment type was the implementation of
      low stakes "your turn" assignments following every 2-3 lecture
      videos.</strong> These were designed to mimic the daily
      face-to-face group activities, to establish a learning standard,
      and to give students a pacing framework. Often these were
      quizzes I wrote in Canvas, but other times they were hand
      written calculations or discussion board posts. These formative
      assignments were worth minimal points but were pivotal for
      student success and engagement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Just like the ground lecture which met twice a week, the "your
    turn" assignments were due twice a week. If a student skipped two
    assignments in a row, then I would contact that student
    directly. This allowed me to quickly gauge which students were
    staying on task and which ones were at risk. The students I
    contacted were always thankful for the personal touch and often
    opened up about struggles they were encountering at home or work.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Due to student technology limitations written work could
    be submitted via multiple channels and was accepted in various
    formats</strong> (hand written, typed, pdf, video, image) uploaded
    into Canvas. Typically when teaching a blended course I am quite
    particular about format. But given the shut-down many students did
    not have access to printers or other resources. I am glad I
    accepted multiple styles as I was often impressed with their
    creativity and resourcefulness.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the face-two-face course I limited my Canvas announcements
    or emails to one a week. However, <strong>during the switch to
    remote learning I began sending out announcements/emails at least
    four times a week</strong>. Most were brief communications about
    expectations and new postings, but often they contained words of
    encouragement. All announcements were written but many also
    contained a video version – I wanted them to know that I was still
    there supporting them, and I felt that seeing my face and
    expressions (and dorky chemistry tee-shirts and mugs) regularly
    would help with that. Zoom office hours was also a good time for
    personalized communications.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the first online lab I posted videos and pictures of the lab
    as performed by Kalamazoo Valley Lab staff and faculty. I then
    asked them to complete a similar lab assignment as would have been
    submitted in the face-to-face lab. However, students really
    struggled with the concepts and assignment. It was clear that not
    performing the experiment themselves really diminished their
    ability to connect the tangible measurements and observations to
    general theory. For the remaining labs I replaced portions of the
    lab videos and images with PhET or other simulations. Students
    were asked to interact with the simulations and answer questions
    guiding them to connect the macroscopic with the particulate.
  </li>
  <li>
    They wanted to remain part of a community. Therefore, <strong>I
    brought in outside resources to make them feel like part of a
    larger science community</strong>. One such example was
    supplementing the online spectroscopy lab with a podcast I found
    on the life of Albert Einstein. It prompted a <strong>unique
    discussion board conversation</strong>. My class found Einstein's
    zig-zag career trajectory very interesting in light of our current
    situation. Many students resonated with some aspect of his life.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, <strong>it was clear that many of my students were scared
      and experiencing high anxiety</strong>. I wanted to try to help
      them in some way so I grasped onto Marie Curie's eloquent
      statement "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be
      understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may
      fear less." Therefore, <strong>I brought in two literature
      assignments designed to help them connect their chemistry
      knowledge to the pandemic with the hope that understanding the
      connections would alleviate their worries</strong>. For both
      assignments I curated reputable articles and/or videos from the
      internet with a focus on the concept of "structure determines
      function." The first assignment focused on the molecular
      structure of potential COVID-19 treatments. The second
      assignment focused on how soap and hand sanitizers interact with
      and destroy viruses. It was clear students appreciated learning
      more about these topics and connecting the concepts from the
      class to their current situation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Without a doubt I wish that COVID-19 was not here and that the
  switch to online never occurred. However, given the situation I can
  truly say I have been so impressed with how the KVCC students,
  faculty, administration, and staff rose to the challenge. My
  students during that last term were tenacious, and I learned so much
  about how to foster a creative and equitable learning environment.
  Currently I am teaching a summer online chemistry class, and while I
  am still grappling with many aspects, I know this class and future
  face-to-face, blended, and online classes will benefit from the
  crash course which was the abrupt switch to remote
  learning. COVID-19 has changed many things in our society, and
  clearly education, like everything else, will never be the same.

<h2>Microbiology Online</h2>
<p class="author">By Cynthia Schauer</p>

<p>
  It has been challenging to move from the face-to-face (f-t-f)
  classroom to remote learning for the microbiology classes I teach at
  Kalamazoo Valley Community College (KVCC).  Like the rest of the
  world we made the switch in dramatic fashion, overnight.  Those
  first days were spent trying to assure people everything would be
  okay…we would get through this.  We DID persevere ….most of the
  students completed the semester and the grades were really similar
  to all the other terms.
</p>
<p>
  The challenge of remote learning did not end with our Winter 2020
  semester.  While wrestling with technology and online learning, we
  started the conversations on our next steps. With 'Stay-at-Home'
  orders in place, what would summer term look like?  Surrounded by a
  supportive Dean and science colleagues ready for the next challenge,
  the health care pre-requisite science classes (Chemistry,
  Microbiology, Anatomy, and Human Physiology) launched an aggressive
  schedule for summer term: All of these classes would be offered
  fully online.
</p>
<p>
  Students have been very supportive of me and each other.  They were
  delighted to have classes in which to enroll so they could continue
  their education.  The online microbiology class relies on laboratory
  simulations in place of the hands-on laboratory
  exercises. <strong>Our college purchased an online simulation
  software and made it available for free to the students.</strong> I
  have re-written the lab exercises to help students achieve the
  outcomes through these virtual exercises. I have not been active in
  the video game scene, but now find myself wired with headphones and
  navigating virtual realities like a gamer!
</p>
<p>
  One of the significant changes in online class delivery is the
  opportunity to <strong>connect the subject to personal
  values</strong>. We have a discussion component in the class where
  students read articles, summarize, and respond. These discussions
  have a depth that I have not had in the f-t-f classroom
  discussions. <strong>Another benefit is that everyone
  participates.</strong> Students who would normally sit quietly on
  the sidelines and not give voice to their incredible ideas, are now
  contributing in important ways to these meaningful discussions.
</p>
<p>
  While I look forward to a future back in the lab and in front of a
  f-t-f class of students, for now, this online learning is an
  opportunity. I am learning a lot, and I hope to continue to
  integrate those successful and enriching aspects of the virtual
  classroom into my f-t-f teaching.
</p>
