  It was a privilege to represent our Local Section at the16th Annual
  ChemLuminary Awards celebration during the 248th ACS National
  Meeting in San Francisco, CA, on 12 August 2014. The goal of the
  ceremony was to recognize local sections, regional meetings, and
  divisions for their efforts to promote chemistry and the chemical
  sciences during 2013.
</p>

<p>
  The evening began with a reception during which finalists displayed
  posters and banners to highlight their outstanding activities being
  recognized. The awards presentation was opened by ACS President Tom
  Barton and followed by a keynote address by Dr. Robert A. Pribush
  (Butler University) titled &ldquo;Volunteerism and the Ripple Effect
  &ndash; Drop a Pebble Today!&rdquo; He was the recipient of the 2014
  ACS Volunteer Service Award and was recognized for his exemplary
  volunteer efforts in the Indiana Local Section, with ACS Governance,
  with the ACS Exams Institute, and with Regional
  Meetings. Afterwards, the celebration continued on the dance floor
  until midnight. A total of 17 committees identified outstanding
  volunteer work by 187 ACS Local Sections, 32 Divisions and 8
  Regional Meetings in 2013. This year, KACS was a
  ChemLuminary <strong>finalist in three categories</strong>
  and <strong>won the coveted price in two of them</strong>. As the
  designated representative, it was my distinct pleasure to walk up to
  the stage and accept both awards on behalf of our Local
  Section. Dr. David Gottfried, chair of the Committee on Public
  Relations and Communications, gave the first award &ldquo;to
  recognize Local Sections for outstanding efforts in promoting
  chemistry to the public.&rdquo; The <em>Chemistry &amp; Culture:
  Elements of Dance</em> event at the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts on
  November 1, 2013 was acknowledged as the <em>Best New Public Relations
  Program of a Local Section</em>. It was made possible through funding by
  by AAAS, Aldrich Chemistry, WMU President Office, WMU-BTR, and Bader
  Fine Arts Collection.
</p>
<p>
  The second award was given by the chair of the Corporation
  Associates Committee, Dr. Dawn Mason, &ldquo;to recognize
  outstanding efforts in producing an event that benefits industry
  members or students seeking a career in industry.&rdquo; Our section
  received it for the poster session at Bell’s Eccentric Caf&eacute;
  titled <em>Sustainable Science &ndash; Recycle a Poster</em>, which
  took place on Oct. 8, 2013 for the third year in a row. It was made
  possible through a generous grant from Zoetis and attended by about
  100 people.
</p>
<p>
  Last but not least, I would like to thank everybody who
  has graciously volunteered his / her time when I chaired the Local
  Section for two years in a row. This recognition would not have been
  possible without this team effort!

  Here is what the Local Sections Activities Committee (LSAC) had to
  say about us:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Kalamazoo Local Section's website states: &ldquo;We are a dynamic
    and visionary organization committed to improving people's lives
    in our community through the transforming power of chemistry. We
    strive to advance the broader chemistry enterprise and its
    practitioners for the benefit of Kalamazoo, Allegan and Van Buren
    counties&rdquo;. That vision and mission are being fulfilled and your
    Section continues to impress me with the scope and quality of your
    many activities. Several significant anniversaries were
    celebrated in 2013, including the <em>Awards Ceremony</em> (40 years),
    <em>High School Chemistry Symposium</em> (40 years), <em>Chemistry
      Day at the Museum</em> (as part of NCW, 27 times over 26
    years), <em>Project SEED</em> (23 years), and <em>Chemists
      Celebrate Earth Day</em> (10 years)! What a splendid record of
    continuous effort and yet these activities and events continue
    to grow and improve. <em>Chemistry Day at the Museum</em>
    featured nearly 30 hands-on activities or displays and reached
    over 700 visitors this year with 87 volunteers, including new
    student helpers. The innovative Chemistry &amp; Culture event,
    Elements of Dance, was held again this year and attracted more
    than 200 participants. Inviting the Mayor of Kalamazoo to be the
    Celebrity MC certainly did increase the Section's visibility! A
    Science Caf&eacute; Mini-Grant resulted in <em>Horticultural
      Chemistry &ndash; Color in Flowers</em> event. The innovative
    <em>Recycle a Poster</em> event is one that would fit well into
    many Local Sections seeking to increase industry involvement. The
    stated plan of the ACS Climate Science Grant is to integrate the
    ACS Climate Science Toolkit into its educational outreach activity
    involving education directors or mission leaders in faith-based
    congregations with middle and high school science teachers, and
    with Scout leaders. In partnership with the WMU Climate Science
    Study Group, this ambitious and innovative plan is slated for
    implementation in 2014. It will provide an interesting model for
    other Sections to consider. Many more examples of the Kalamazoo
    Section’s activities could be cited, but it is clear that the
    Kalamazoo Section sets and achieves a high standard of
    activity. KACS goals are also well coordinated with the goals of
    the ACS Strategic Plan
    (www.acs.org/strategicplan). Congratulations on all of your
    high-impact events that both serve your members and involve your
    local community.
