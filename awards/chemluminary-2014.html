<p>
  Here is what the Local Sections Activities Committee (LSAC) had to
  say about us:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Kalamazoo Local Section's website states: &ldquo;We are a dynamic
    and visionary organization committed to improving people's lives
    in our community through the transforming power of chemistry. We
    strive to advance the broader chemistry enterprise and its
    practitioners for the benefit of Kalamazoo, Allegan and Van Buren
    counties&rdquo;. That vision and mission are being fulfilled and your
    Section continues to impress me with the scope and quality of your
    many activities. Several significant anniversaries were
    celebrated in 2013, including the <em>Awards Ceremony</em> (40 years),
    <em>High School Chemistry Symposium</em> (40 years), <em>Chemistry
      Day at the Museum</em> (as part of NCW, 27 times over 26
    years), <em>Project SEED</em> (23 years), and <em>Chemists
      Celebrate Earth Day</em> (10 years)! What a splendid record of
    continuous effort and yet these activities and events continue
    to grow and improve. <em>Chemistry Day at the Museum</em>
    featured nearly 30 hands-on activities or displays and reached
    over 700 visitors this year with 87 volunteers, including new
    student helpers. The innovative Chemistry &amp; Culture event,
    Elements of Dance, was held again this year and attracted more
    than 200 participants. Inviting the Mayor of Kalamazoo to be the
    Celebrity MC certainly did increase the Section's visibility! A
    Science Caf&eacute; Mini-Grant resulted in <em>Horticultural
      Chemistry &ndash; Color in Flowers</em> event. The innovative
    <em>Recycle a Poster</em> event is one that would fit well into
    many Local Sections seeking to increase industry involvement. The
    stated plan of the ACS Climate Science Grant is to integrate the
    ACS Climate Science Toolkit into its educational outreach activity
    involving education directors or mission leaders in faith-based
    congregations with middle and high school science teachers, and
    with Scout leaders. In partnership with the WMU Climate Science
    Study Group, this ambitious and innovative plan is slated for
    implementation in 2014. It will provide an interesting model for
    other Sections to consider. Many more examples of the Kalamazoo
    Sectionâ€™s activities could be cited, but it is clear that the
    Kalamazoo Section sets and achieves a high standard of
    activity. KACS goals are also well coordinated with the goals of
    the ACS Strategic Plan
    (www.acs.org/strategicplan). Congratulations on all of your
    high-impact events that both serve your members and involve your
    local community.
